00:00:06,239 --> 00:00:10,733
THE PRINCESS BRIDE

2
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:36,292
Hi, honey.

3
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:38,030
Hi, Mom.

4
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:42,368
You feeling any better?

5
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:44,467
A little bit.

6
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,478
Guess what.

7
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:47,638
What?

8
00:00:47,747 --> 00:00:49,442
Grandfather's here.

9
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:52,518
Mom, can't you tell him
that I'm sick?

10
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:55,747
You're sick.
That's why he's here.

11
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:57,551
He'll pinch my cheek.

12
00:00:57,624 --> 00:00:59,182
I hate that.

13
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:00,954
Maybe he won't.

14
00:01:01,027 --> 00:01:04,485
How's the sickie?

15
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:10,426
I'll leave you two pals alone.

16
00:01:10,503 --> 00:01:13,768
I brought you a special present.

17
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,671
- What is it?
- Open it up.

18
00:01:21,147 --> 00:01:23,206
- A book?
- That's right.

19
00:01:23,316 --> 00:01:26,410
When I was your age,
television was called books.

20
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:28,749
This is a special book.

21
00:01:28,822 --> 00:01:32,087
It was the book my father used
to read to me when I was sick...

22
00:01:32,158 --> 00:01:34,490
and I used to read it
to your father.

23
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:37,086
Today I'm going to read it
to you.

24
00:01:37,163 --> 00:01:39,222
Does it got any sports in it?

25
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:40,664
Are you kidding?

26
00:01:40,733 --> 00:01:44,635
Fencing, fighting,
torture, revenge...

27
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:47,172
giants, monsters, chases...

28
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:51,108
escapes, true love, miracles.

29
00:01:51,177 --> 00:01:53,077
That doesn't sound too bad.

30
00:01:53,146 --> 00:01:55,546
I'll try and stay awake.

31
00:01:55,648 --> 00:01:59,015
Thank you very much.
That's very nice of you.

32
00:01:59,085 --> 00:02:01,645
Your vote of confidence
is overwhelming.

33
00:02:01,754 --> 00:02:03,688
All right.

34
00:02:03,823 --> 00:02:08,351
"The Princess Bride...

35
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:10,362
"by S. Morgenstern.

36
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,364
"Chapter One.

37
00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:15,367
"Buttercup was raised
on a small farm...

38
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:17,369
"in the country of Florin.

39
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:20,372
"Her favorite pastimes
were riding her horse...

40
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,375
"and tormenting the farm boy
that worked there.

41
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:27,379
"His name was Westley,
but she never called him that."

42
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:29,472
Isn't that
a wonderful beginning?

43
00:02:29,582 --> 00:02:32,847
Yeah, it's really good.

44
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:36,047
"Nothing gave Buttercup
as much pleasure...

45
00:02:36,122 --> 00:02:38,056
as ordering Westley around."

46
00:02:38,124 --> 00:02:40,752
Farm boy,
polish my horse's saddle.

47
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:43,728
I want to see my face
shining in it by morning.

48
00:02:43,796 --> 00:02:45,593
As you wish.

49
00:02:48,801 --> 00:02:51,964
"As you wish"
was all he ever said to her.

50
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:57,240
Farm boy, fill these with water.

51
00:02:58,778 --> 00:03:00,769
Please.

52
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:03,213
As you wish.

53
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,653
That day she was amazed
to discover...

54
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:11,588
that when he was saying,
"As you wish"...

55
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:13,785
what he meant was,
"I love you."

56
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:19,022
Even more amazing
was the day she realized...

57
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:21,430
she truly loved him back.

58
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:24,096
Farm boy.

59
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:32,377
Fetch me that pitcher.

60
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:49,419
As you wish.

61
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:00,768
Hold it, hold it.

62
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,707
What is this?
Are you trying to trick me?

63
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:05,710
And where's the sports?

64
00:04:05,778 --> 00:04:08,576
Is this a kissing book?

65
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:10,376
Wait. Just wait.

66
00:04:10,483 --> 00:04:12,576
When does it get good?

67
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:15,620
Keep your shirt on
and let me read.

68
00:04:15,688 --> 00:04:18,054
"Westley had no money
for marriage...

69
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:20,592
"so he packed his few belongings
and left the farm...

70
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,491
"to seek his fortune
across the sea."

71
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:26,396
It was a very emotional time
for Buttercup.

72
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:28,627
I don't believe this!

73
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:31,727
I fear I'll never see you again.

74
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:33,829
Of course you will.

75
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:37,103
What if something
happens to you?

76
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,908
Hear this now...

77
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:45,644
I will always come for you.

78
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:49,153
But how can you be sure?

79
00:04:49,255 --> 00:04:51,120
This is true love.

80
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:55,654
Do you think this happens
every day?

81
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:09,568
Westley didn't reach
his destination.

82
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:12,907
His ship was attacked
by the Dread Pirate Roberts...

83
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:15,345
who never left captives alive.

84
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:18,383
When Buttercup got the news
that Westley was murdered...

85
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:20,351
Murdered by pirates is good!

86
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,354
She went into her room
and shut the door...

87
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:25,652
and for days
she neither slept nor ate.

88
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:28,421
I will never love again.

89
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:37,391
Five years later, the main
square of Florin City...

90
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:40,564
was filled as never before
to hear the announcement...

91
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,268
of the great Prince
Humperdinck's bride-to-be.

92
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:54,550
My people...

93
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,815
a month from now...

94
00:05:56,889 --> 00:06:00,791
our country
will have its 500th anniversary.

95
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:04,956
On that sundown,
I shall marry a lady...

96
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:08,558
who was once a commoner
like yourselves...

97
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:14,402
but perhaps you will not
find her common now.

98
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:16,374
Would you like to meet her?

99
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:24,446
My people,
the princess Buttercup!

100
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:47,595
Buttercup's emptiness
consumed her.

101
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:50,141
Although the law of the land
gave Humperdinck...

102
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:52,439
the right to choose his bride...

103
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:55,310
she did not love him.

104
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:01,514
Despite Humperdinck's
reassurance...

105
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:03,851
that she would grow
to love him...

106
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:07,450
the only joy she found
was in her daily ride.

107
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:21,573
A word, my lady?

108
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:26,578
We are but poor,
lost circus performers.

109
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:29,171
Is there a village nearby?

110
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:32,411
There is nothing nearby,
not for miles.

111
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:36,012
Then there will be no one
to hear you scream.

112
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:44,587
What is that you're ripping?

113
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:47,894
It's fabric from the uniform
of an army officer of Guilder.

114
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,592
Who's Guilder?

115
00:07:49,702 --> 00:07:53,160
The country across the sea,
the sworn enemy of Florin.

116
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:54,432
Go!

117
00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:56,975
Once the horse
reaches the castle...

118
00:07:57,043 --> 00:07:58,738
the fabric will make
the prince suspect...

119
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:01,177
that the Guilderians
have abducted his love.

120
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:03,943
When he finds her body dead
on the Guilder frontier...

121
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:06,541
his suspicions
will be totally confirmed.

122
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:09,110
You never said anything
about killing anyone.

123
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:11,782
I've hired you to help me
start a war.

124
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:13,587
It's a prestigious
line of work...

125
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:16,492
with a long
and glorious tradition.

126
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:19,895
I just don't think it's right,
killing an innocent girl.

127
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:25,096
Am I going mad, or did the word
"think" escape your lips?

128
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,401
You were not hired
for your brains...

129
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:29,065
you hippopotamic land mass!

130
00:08:29,141 --> 00:08:30,631
I agree with Fezzik.

131
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:33,076
The sot has spoken!

132
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:35,943
What happens to her
is not truly your concern!

133
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,448
I will kill her!

134
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,508
And remember this,
never forget this...

135
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:42,247
When I found you,
you were so slobbering drunk...

136
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:44,551
you couldn't buy brandy!

137
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:48,526
And you...
friendless, brainless...

138
00:08:48,594 --> 00:08:50,528
helpless, hopeless!

139
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:53,963
Do you want me to send you
back to where you were...

140
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:57,230
unemployed in Greenland?

141
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:14,783
That Vizzini, he can... fuss.

142
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:16,287
Fuss, fuss...

143
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:20,291
I think he like to scream...
at us.

144
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:24,955
Probably he means no... harm.

145
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:28,397
He's really very short on...
charm.

146
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:31,334
You have a great gift for rhyme.

147
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,338
Yes, yes, some of the time.

148
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,533
Enough of that!

149
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:37,337
Fezzik, are there rocks ahead?

150
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:40,345
If there are, we'll all be dead.

151
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:43,348
No more rhymes, now. I mean it!

152
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,384
Anybody want a peanut?

153
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,618
We'll reach the cliffs by dawn.

154
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:00,024
Why are you doing that?

155
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:02,600
Making sure
nobody's following us.

156
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:04,567
That would be inconceivable.

157
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:06,628
Despite what you think...

158
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:09,367
you will be caught,
and when you are...

159
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,740
the prince
will see you all hanged.

160
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:14,439
Of all the necks on this boat,
Highness...

161
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:17,243
the one you should be
worrying about is your own.

162
00:10:22,154 --> 00:10:23,416
Stop doing that!

163
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:25,753
We can all relax.
It's almost over.

164
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:27,520
You are sure
nobody's following us?

165
00:10:27,593 --> 00:10:30,619
As I told you, it would be
absolutely, totally...

166
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:33,028
and in all other ways
inconceivable!

167
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:35,066
No one in Guilder
knows what we've done...

168
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:38,626
and no one in Florin
could have gotten here so fast.

169
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:43,141
Out of curiosity,
why do you ask?

170
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:47,441
I happened to look behind us,
and something is there.

171
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:48,946
What?

172
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,846
Probably some local fisherman...

173
00:10:57,923 --> 00:11:00,483
out for a pleasure cruise
at night...

174
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:02,823
through eel-infested waters.

175
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:05,786
What?

176
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:07,331
Go in! Get after her!

177
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,027
I don't swim.

178
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:10,864
I only dog-paddle.

179
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:14,939
Veer left!

180
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:18,603
Left!

181
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:30,387
Do you know what that sound is,
Highness?

182
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:33,050
Those are the shrieking eels.

183
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,616
If you don't believe me,
just wait.

184
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,993
They always grow louder...

185
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:41,396
when they're about to feed
on human flesh.

186
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:45,003
If you swim back now...

187
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:48,039
I promise no harm
will come to you.

188
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:52,372
I doubt you'll get such an offer
from the eels.

189
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:04,515
She doesn't get eaten
by the eels at this time.

190
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:05,887
What?

191
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:07,892
The eel doesn't get her.

192
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,793
I'm explaining to you
because you look nervous.

193
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:13,660
I wasn't nervous.

194
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:17,969
Maybe I was
a little bit concerned...

195
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:19,527
but that's not the same thing.

196
00:12:19,638 --> 00:12:21,970
Because we can stop now
if you want.

197
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:25,807
No. You could read
a little bit more, if you want.

198
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:30,247
"Do you know
what that sound is, Highness?

199
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:32,614
"Those are the shrieking eels."

200
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:35,119
Pass that, Grandpa.
You read it already.

201
00:12:35,187 --> 00:12:38,020
My goodness, I did.

202
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,615
I'm sorry. Beg your pardon.

203
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:42,285
All right, all right. Let's see.

204
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:45,228
She was in the water,
the eel was coming after her...

205
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:46,559
she was frightened...

206
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:48,724
the eel started to charge her,
and then...

207
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,871
Put her down. Just put her down!

208
00:12:58,644 --> 00:13:00,134
I think he's getting closer.

209
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:02,203
He's no concern of ours.

210
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:03,839
Sail on!

211
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:06,180
I suppose you think
you're brave, don't you?

212
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:08,777
Only compared to some.

213
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,327
Look! He's right on top of us!

214
00:13:17,396 --> 00:13:20,160
I wonder if he's using
the same wind we are using.

215
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:23,758
Whoever he is, he's too late.
See?

216
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:28,371
The Cliffs of Insanity!

217
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,431
Hurry up!

218
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:32,340
Move the thing!

219
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:35,107
And that other thing!

220
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:37,547
Move it!

221
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:43,116
We're safe.

222
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:45,783
Only Fezzik is strong enough
to go up our way.

223
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:49,624
He'll have to sail for hours
till he finds a harbor.

224
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:38,434
He's climbing the rope,
and he's gaining on us!

225
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:40,102
Inconceivable!

226
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:43,578
Faster!

227
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:45,742
I thought I was going faster.

228
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:48,048
You were supposed to be
this colossus...

229
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,883
you were
this great legendary thing...

230
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:51,582
and yet he gains!

231
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:54,921
I'm carrying three people,
and he got only himself.

232
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:59,124
I do not accept excuses.
I have to find a new giant.

233
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:01,792
Don't say that, Vizzini, please.

234
00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:11,102
Did I make it clear
that your job is at stake?

235
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:13,968
He's got very good arms.

236
00:16:15,841 --> 00:16:17,775
He didn't fall?

237
00:16:17,843 --> 00:16:19,276
Inconceivable!

238
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:21,279
You keep using that word.

239
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:25,249
I do not think it means
what you think it means.

240
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:28,650
My God, he's climbing.

241
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:31,315
Whoever he is, he's obviously
seen us with the princess...

242
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:32,651
and must therefore die.

243
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:34,157
You carry her.

244
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:35,853
We'll head straight
for the Guilder frontier.

245
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:37,326
Catch up when he's dead.

246
00:16:37,396 --> 00:16:39,830
If he falls, fine.
If not, the sword.

247
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:42,298
I'm going to duel him
left-handed.

248
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:44,598
You know what a hurry we're in.

249
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,535
It's the only way
I can be satisfied.

250
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:49,403
If I use my right, tsk!
Over too quickly.

251
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:51,204
Have it your way!

252
00:16:58,484 --> 00:16:59,678
You be careful.

253
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:01,777
People in masks
cannot be trusted.

254
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:05,047
I'm waiting!

255
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:19,230
Hello there!

256
00:17:22,841 --> 00:17:24,468
Slow going?

257
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:28,411
I don't mean to be rude, but
this is not as easy as it looks.

258
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,381
I'd appreciate it
if you wouldn't distract me.

259
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:32,849
- Sorry.
- Thank you.

260
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,189
I do not suppose
you could speed things up?

261
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:46,754
If you're in such a hurry...

262
00:17:46,865 --> 00:17:49,060
you could lower a rope
or a tree branch...

263
00:17:49,134 --> 00:17:51,295
or find something useful to do.

264
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:55,670
I could do that.
I got some rope up here...

265
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,868
but I do not think
you would accept my help...

266
00:17:57,943 --> 00:18:00,070
since I am only waiting around
to kill you.

267
00:18:00,145 --> 00:18:03,308
That does put a damper
on our relationship.

268
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:07,876
But I promise I won't kill you
until you reach the top.

269
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:11,980
That's very comforting, but I'm
afraid you'll just have to wait.

270
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,922
I hate waiting.

271
00:18:13,992 --> 00:18:16,927
I could give you my word
as a Spaniard.

272
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:18,496
No good.

273
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,531
I've known too many Spaniards.

274
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,692
Any way you'll trust me?

275
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,827
Nothing comes to mind.

276
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:29,397
I swear on the soul
of my father, Domingo Montoya...

277
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:31,534
you will reach the top alive.

278
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,737
Throw me the rope.

279
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:05,303
Thank you.

280
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:08,813
Wait.
We'll wait until you're ready.

281
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:10,849
Again, thank you.

282
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:27,529
I do not mean to pry,
but you don't by any chance...

283
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:30,193
happen to have six fingers
on your right hand?

284
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:34,028
Do you always begin
conversations this way?

285
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:37,633
My father was slaughtered
by a six-fingered man.

286
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,949
He was a great swordmaker,
my father.

287
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:48,452
When the six-fingered man
appeared...

288
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,454
and request a special sword...

289
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:52,490
my father took the job.

290
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:56,050
He slaved a year
before he was done.

291
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,866
I've never seen its equal.

292
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:12,001
The six-fingered man
returned and demanded it...

293
00:20:12,077 --> 00:20:14,511
but at 1/10 his promised price.

294
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,514
My father refused.

295
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:18,550
Without a word...

296
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:22,519
the six-fingered man
slashed him through the heart.

297
00:20:22,588 --> 00:20:24,556
I loved my father.

298
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:28,217
So naturally, I challenged
his murderer to a duel.

299
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:31,023
I failed.

300
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:35,232
The six-fingered man
leave me alive...

301
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:38,030
but he gave me this.

302
00:20:40,772 --> 00:20:42,103
How old were you?

303
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:44,506
I was eleven years old.

304
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:46,510
When I was strong enough...

305
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:50,378
I dedicated my life
to the study of fencing.

306
00:20:50,449 --> 00:20:55,386
So the next time we meet,
I will not fail.

307
00:20:55,454 --> 00:21:00,687
I will go up to
the six-fingered man and say...

308
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:02,384
"Hello.

309
00:21:02,494 --> 00:21:05,429
"My name is Inigo Montoya.

310
00:21:05,497 --> 00:21:08,432
"You killed my father.

311
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,661
"Prepare to die."

312
00:21:10,736 --> 00:21:14,137
You've done nothing
but study swordplay?

313
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:17,334
More pursuit than study lately.

314
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:19,570
You see, I cannot find him.

315
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:22,978
It's been twenty years now.
I'm starting to lose confidence.

316
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:25,346
I just work for Vizzini
to pay the bills.

317
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:27,647
There's not a lot of money
in revenge.

318
00:21:29,521 --> 00:21:32,958
I certainly hope
you find him someday.

319
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:33,947
You're ready, then?

320
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:35,857
Whether I am or not,
you've been more than fair.

321
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:39,294
You seem a decent fellow.
I hate to kill you.

322
00:21:39,398 --> 00:21:42,265
You seem a decent fellow.
I hate to die.

323
00:21:43,602 --> 00:21:45,729
Begin.

324
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:19,633
You are using Bonetti's defense
against me?

325
00:22:19,705 --> 00:22:22,299
I thought it fitting
considering the rocky terrain.

326
00:22:22,374 --> 00:22:24,934
Naturally. You must expect me
to attack with Capo Ferro.

327
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:28,639
Naturally, but I find that
Thibault cancels out Capo Ferro.

328
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:31,239
Don't you?

329
00:22:31,316 --> 00:22:33,216
Unless the enemy
has studied Agrippa.

330
00:22:35,153 --> 00:22:37,144
Which I have.

331
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:43,085
You are wonderful!

332
00:22:43,161 --> 00:22:45,129
Thank you.
I've worked hard to become so.

333
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:47,198
I admit it.
You are better than I am.

334
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:48,767
Then why are you smiling?

335
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:50,564
Because I know something
you don't know.

336
00:22:50,635 --> 00:22:51,863
What is that?

337
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:53,871
I am not left-handed.

338
00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:05,382
You're amazing.

339
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:08,544
I ought to be,
after twenty years.

340
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,713
There's something
I ought to tell you.

341
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:12,017
Tell me.

342
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:14,422
I'm not left-handed, either.

343
00:23:40,318 --> 00:23:42,513
Who are you?

344
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:44,145
No one of consequence.

345
00:23:44,222 --> 00:23:45,712
I must know.

346
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:47,520
Get used to disappointment.

347
00:24:31,603 --> 00:24:33,594
Kill me quickly.

348
00:24:33,705 --> 00:24:35,502
I would sooner destroy
a stained-glass window...

349
00:24:35,574 --> 00:24:36,939
as an artist like yourself.

350
00:24:37,008 --> 00:24:40,466
However, since I can't have you
following me, either.

351
00:24:43,515 --> 00:24:47,542
Please understand, I hold you
in the highest respect.

352
00:24:58,763 --> 00:25:00,253
Inconceivable!

353
00:25:00,365 --> 00:25:02,765
Give her to me!
Catch up with us quickly!

354
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:03,892
What do I do?

355
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:05,936
Finish him,
finish him... your way!

356
00:25:06,037 --> 00:25:09,131
Good, my way.
Thank you, Vizzini.

357
00:25:09,207 --> 00:25:11,767
Which way's my way?

358
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:14,744
Pick up one of those rocks,
get behind the boulder.

359
00:25:14,813 --> 00:25:16,007
In a few minutes...

360
00:25:16,081 --> 00:25:18,481
the man in black will come
running around the bend.

361
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:22,816
The minute his head is in view,
hit it with the rock!

362
00:25:24,055 --> 00:25:26,853
My way is not
very sportsmanlike.

363
00:25:55,487 --> 00:25:57,421
I did that on purpose.

364
00:25:57,489 --> 00:25:59,514
I didn't have to miss.

365
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:01,422
I believe you.

366
00:26:01,493 --> 00:26:04,121
So what happens now?

367
00:26:04,195 --> 00:26:07,130
We face each other
as God intended.

368
00:26:07,198 --> 00:26:08,631
Sportsmanlike.

369
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:12,329
No tricks, no weapons.
Skill against skill alone.

370
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:16,067
You'll put down your rock,
and I'll put down my sword...

371
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:18,473
and we'll try and kill each
other like civilized people?

372
00:26:18,543 --> 00:26:20,875
I could kill you now.

373
00:26:20,946 --> 00:26:22,880
Frankly, I think the odds...

374
00:26:22,948 --> 00:26:26,406
are slightly in your favor
at hand-fighting.

375
00:26:26,484 --> 00:26:29,783
It's not my fault being
the biggest and the strongest.

376
00:26:29,854 --> 00:26:31,754
I don't even exercise.

377
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:54,078
Are you just fiddling around
with me, or what?

378
00:26:54,145 --> 00:26:56,978
I want you to feel
you are doing well.

379
00:26:57,048 --> 00:26:58,675
I hate for people
to die embarrassed.

380
00:27:00,885 --> 00:27:02,318
You're quick!

381
00:27:02,387 --> 00:27:03,752
Good thing, too!

382
00:27:03,822 --> 00:27:04,982
Why are you wearing a mask?

383
00:27:05,056 --> 00:27:06,956
Were you burned with acid
or something like that?

384
00:27:07,025 --> 00:27:09,084
No. It's just they're
terribly comfortable.

385
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,492
I think everyone will be
wearing them in the future.

386
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:20,634
I just figured why you
give me so much trouble.

387
00:27:20,705 --> 00:27:24,266
Why is that, do you think?

388
00:27:24,342 --> 00:27:29,370
I haven't fought
just one person for so long.

389
00:27:29,447 --> 00:27:32,610
I've been specializing
in groups.

390
00:27:32,684 --> 00:27:34,777
Battling gangs
for local charities...

391
00:27:34,853 --> 00:27:36,150
that kind of thing.

392
00:27:38,123 --> 00:27:41,058
Why should that make
such a... Oof! Difference?

393
00:27:41,126 --> 00:27:43,219
Well, you see...

394
00:27:43,294 --> 00:27:44,955
you use different moves...

395
00:27:45,063 --> 00:27:49,363
when you're fighting
half a dozen people...

396
00:27:49,434 --> 00:27:51,402
than when you only...

397
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:55,837
have to be worried about one.

398
00:28:08,219 --> 00:28:11,313
I do not envy you the headache
you will have when you awake.

399
00:28:11,389 --> 00:28:16,019
But in the meantime, rest well
and dream of large women.

400
00:28:33,144 --> 00:28:35,339
There was...

401
00:28:35,413 --> 00:28:37,881
a mighty duel.

402
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:42,347
It ranged all over.

403
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,445
They were both masters.

404
00:28:44,522 --> 00:28:46,888
Who won? How did it end?

405
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:50,359
The loser ran off alone...

406
00:28:50,462 --> 00:28:57,334
while the winner... followed
those footprints toward Guilder.

407
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:59,393
Shall we track them both?

408
00:28:59,504 --> 00:29:01,836
The loser is nothing.

409
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:04,306
Only the princess matters.

410
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:07,310
Clearly, this was all planned
by warriors of Guilder.

411
00:29:07,378 --> 00:29:10,779
We must all be ready
for whatever lies ahead.

412
00:29:10,849 --> 00:29:12,111
Could this be a trap?

413
00:29:12,183 --> 00:29:15,016
I always think
everything could be a trap.

414
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:17,111
That is why I'm still alive.

415
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:32,597
So, it is down to you,
and it is down to me.

416
00:29:34,639 --> 00:29:36,266
If you wish her dead...

417
00:29:36,341 --> 00:29:38,605
by all means,
keep moving forward.

418
00:29:38,676 --> 00:29:40,371
Let me explain.

419
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:42,379
There's nothing to explain.

420
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:45,211
You're trying to kidnap
what I've rightfully stolen.

421
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:48,081
Perhaps... an arrangement
can be reached.

422
00:29:48,153 --> 00:29:51,953
There will be no arrangement,
and you're killing her.

423
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:58,195
If there can be no arrangement,
then we are at an impasse.

424
00:29:58,296 --> 00:29:59,388
I'm afraid so.

425
00:29:59,497 --> 00:30:01,931
I can't compete with you
physically...

426
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,730
and you're no match
for my brains.

427
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:05,895
You're that smart?

428
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,403
Let me put it this way...

429
00:30:07,505 --> 00:30:10,633
have you ever heard of Plato,
Aristotle, Socrates?

430
00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:12,369
- Yes.
- Morons.

431
00:30:12,443 --> 00:30:13,535
Really?

432
00:30:13,611 --> 00:30:17,342
In that case, I challenge you
to a battle of wits.

433
00:30:17,415 --> 00:30:19,815
For the princess?

434
00:30:19,884 --> 00:30:22,284
To the death?

435
00:30:22,353 --> 00:30:23,843
I accept.

436
00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:25,981
Good, then pour the wine.

437
00:30:40,772 --> 00:30:43,741
Inhale this, but do not touch.

438
00:30:45,577 --> 00:30:47,374
I smell nothing.

439
00:30:47,445 --> 00:30:49,436
What you do not smell
is called iocane powder.

440
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:52,244
It is odorless, tasteless,
dissolves instantly in liquid...

441
00:30:52,317 --> 00:30:55,844
and is among the more deadly
poisons known to man.

442
00:31:17,508 --> 00:31:19,942
All right.
Where is the poison?

443
00:31:20,011 --> 00:31:22,639
The battle of wits has begun.

444
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:24,682
It ends when you decide,
and we both drink...

445
00:31:24,749 --> 00:31:26,376
and find out who is right...

446
00:31:26,451 --> 00:31:28,646
and who is dead.

447
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,950
But it's so simple.

448
00:31:31,022 --> 00:31:33,957
All I have to do is divine
from what I know of you...

449
00:31:34,025 --> 00:31:35,925
are you the sort of man...

450
00:31:35,994 --> 00:31:38,986
who would put the poison into
his own goblet or his enemy's?

451
00:31:39,097 --> 00:31:40,428
A clever man
would put the poison...

452
00:31:40,498 --> 00:31:41,658
into his own goblet...

453
00:31:41,766 --> 00:31:43,563
because he would know
that only a great fool...

454
00:31:43,635 --> 00:31:45,330
would reach
for what he was given.

455
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:46,665
I am not a great fool...

456
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:49,400
so I can clearly not choose
the wine in front of you.

457
00:31:49,474 --> 00:31:51,965
But you must have known
I was not a great fool.

458
00:31:52,043 --> 00:31:53,408
You would have counted on it...

459
00:31:53,478 --> 00:31:56,447
so I can clearly not choose
the wine in front of me.

460
00:31:56,514 --> 00:31:57,811
You've made your decision, then?

461
00:31:57,882 --> 00:31:59,110
Not remotely...

462
00:31:59,183 --> 00:32:02,516
because iocane comes from
Australia, as everyone knows...

463
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:04,987
and Australia is entirely
peopled with criminals...

464
00:32:05,056 --> 00:32:07,718
and criminals are used to
having people not trust them...

465
00:32:07,792 --> 00:32:09,191
as you are not trusted by me...

466
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,820
so I can clearly not choose
the wine in front of you.

467
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,989
Truly,
you have a dizzying intellect.

468
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:16,066
Wait till I get going!

469
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:18,032
- Where was I?
- Australia.

470
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:20,002
Yes, Australia.
You must have suspected...

471
00:32:20,071 --> 00:32:21,766
I would have known
the powder's origin...

472
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:24,330
so I can clearly not choose
the wine in front of me.

473
00:32:24,409 --> 00:32:25,637
You're just stalling now.

474
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:27,974
You'd like to think that,
wouldn't you?

475
00:32:28,046 --> 00:32:29,308
You've beaten my giant...

476
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:31,245
which means
you're exceptionally strong...

477
00:32:31,316 --> 00:32:33,216
so you could have put the poison
in your own goblet...

478
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:34,979
trusting on your strength
to save you...

479
00:32:35,053 --> 00:32:37,613
so I can clearly not choose
the wine in front of you.

480
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:40,089
But you've also
bested my Spaniard...

481
00:32:40,158 --> 00:32:41,489
which means
you must have studied...

482
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:44,585
and in studying, you must have
learned that man is mortal...

483
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:46,425
so you would have
put the poison...

484
00:32:46,531 --> 00:32:48,465
as far from yourself
as possible...

485
00:32:48,566 --> 00:32:50,796
so I can clearly not choose
the wine in front of me.

486
00:32:50,868 --> 00:32:52,733
You're trying to trick me
into giving away something.

487
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:53,896
It won't work.

488
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:56,099
It has worked.
You've given everything away.

489
00:32:56,174 --> 00:32:58,836
- I know where the poison is.
- Then make your choice.

490
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:02,368
I will, and I choose...
What in the world can that be?

491
00:33:02,447 --> 00:33:03,778
What? Where?

492
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:07,542
I don't see anything.

493
00:33:07,618 --> 00:33:10,451
I could have sworn
I saw something. No matter.

494
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,549
What's so funny?

495
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:16,388
I'll tell you in a minute.

496
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:17,927
First, let's drink...

497
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:21,159
me from my glass
and you from yours.

498
00:33:35,713 --> 00:33:36,907
You guessed wrong.

499
00:33:36,981 --> 00:33:39,711
You only think I guessed wrong.
That's what's so funny!

500
00:33:39,784 --> 00:33:41,843
I switched glasses
when your back was turned!

501
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:43,386
You fool!

502
00:33:43,454 --> 00:33:45,945
You fell victim
to one of the classic blunders.

503
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:49,016
The most famous is "Never get
involved in a land war in Asia."

504
00:33:49,093 --> 00:33:51,891
But only slightly
less well known is this...

505
00:33:51,996 --> 00:33:56,262
"Never go in against a Sicilian
when death is on the line!"

506
00:34:10,748 --> 00:34:12,375
Who are you?

507
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:14,680
I am no one to be trifled with.

508
00:34:14,752 --> 00:34:17,016
That is all you ever need know.

509
00:34:17,088 --> 00:34:18,783
And to think, all that time...

510
00:34:18,856 --> 00:34:20,483
it was your cup
that was poisoned.

511
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:22,389
They were both poisoned.

512
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:24,553
I spent the last few years...

513
00:34:24,662 --> 00:34:28,063
building up an immunity
to iocane powder.

514
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:32,435
Someone has beaten the giant.

515
00:34:33,504 --> 00:34:38,271
There will be great suffering
in Guilder if she dies.

516
00:34:52,957 --> 00:34:54,322
Catch your breath.

517
00:34:54,392 --> 00:34:55,654
If you'll release me...

518
00:34:55,726 --> 00:34:59,059
whatever you ask for ransom,
you'll get it. I promise you.

519
00:35:00,565 --> 00:35:03,966
And what is that worth...
the promise of a woman?

520
00:35:04,068 --> 00:35:05,660
You're very funny, Highness.

521
00:35:05,736 --> 00:35:07,499
I was giving you a chance.

522
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:09,870
It does not matter
where you take me...

523
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:12,307
there is no greater hunter
than Prince Humperdinck.

524
00:35:12,376 --> 00:35:14,310
He can track a falcon
on a cloudy day.

525
00:35:14,378 --> 00:35:15,640
He can find you.

526
00:35:15,713 --> 00:35:17,237
You think your dearest love
will save you?

527
00:35:17,315 --> 00:35:18,942
I never said
he was my dearest love.

528
00:35:19,016 --> 00:35:21,712
And, yes, he will save me.
That I know.

529
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:25,381
You admit to me
you do not love your fiancé.

530
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:27,014
He knows I do not love him.

531
00:35:27,091 --> 00:35:29,252
Are not capable of love
is what you mean.

532
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:33,063
I have loved more deeply...

533
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:36,066
than a killer like yourself
could ever dream.

534
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:40,399
That was a warning, Highness.

535
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:42,837
The next time,
my hand flies on its own.

536
00:35:42,907 --> 00:35:45,876
Where I come from, there are
penalties when a woman lies.

537
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:53,473
Iocane. I'd bet my life on it...

538
00:35:53,584 --> 00:35:56,417
and there are
the princess' footprints.

539
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:59,752
She is alive,
or was an hour ago.

540
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:02,918
If she is otherwise
when I find her...

541
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:06,361
I shall be very put out.

542
00:36:11,269 --> 00:36:13,829
- Rest, Highness.
- I know who you are.

543
00:36:13,905 --> 00:36:16,135
Your cruelty reveals everything.

544
00:36:16,207 --> 00:36:18,334
You're the Dread Pirate Roberts.
Admit it.

545
00:36:18,409 --> 00:36:21,810
With pride.
What can I do for you?

546
00:36:21,879 --> 00:36:24,848
You can die slowly,
cut into a thousand pieces.

547
00:36:26,717 --> 00:36:27,945
Hardly complimentary,
Your Highness.

548
00:36:28,052 --> 00:36:30,486
Why loose your venom on me?

549
00:36:30,588 --> 00:36:33,523
You killed my love.

550
00:36:33,591 --> 00:36:35,491
It's possible.

551
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,960
I kill a lot of people.

552
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:40,497
Who was this love of yours?

553
00:36:40,565 --> 00:36:45,298
Another prince like this one...
ugly, rich, and scabby?

554
00:36:46,571 --> 00:36:48,739
A farm boy, poor.

555
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:54,405
Poor and perfect with eyes
like the sea after a storm.

556
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:59,372
On the high seas,
your ship attacked.

557
00:36:59,483 --> 00:37:01,917
And the Dread Pirate Roberts
never takes prisoners.

558
00:37:01,986 --> 00:37:03,544
I can't afford
to make exceptions.

559
00:37:03,654 --> 00:37:05,747
Once word leaks out
that a pirate has gone soft...

560
00:37:05,823 --> 00:37:07,085
people begin to disobey you...

561
00:37:07,158 --> 00:37:09,388
and then it's nothing but work,
work, work all the time.

562
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:10,893
You mock my pain.

563
00:37:10,962 --> 00:37:12,429
Life is pain, Highness.

564
00:37:12,496 --> 00:37:15,761
Anyone who says differently
is selling something.

565
00:37:19,503 --> 00:37:22,939
I remember this farm boy
of yours, I think.

566
00:37:23,007 --> 00:37:25,874
This would be, what,
five years ago?

567
00:37:25,943 --> 00:37:28,935
Does it bother you to hear?

568
00:37:29,013 --> 00:37:32,141
Nothing you can say
will upset me.

569
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,945
He died well.

570
00:37:34,051 --> 00:37:35,985
That should please you.

571
00:37:36,053 --> 00:37:38,988
No bribe attempts or blubbering.

572
00:37:39,056 --> 00:37:41,490
He simply said, "Please...

573
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:44,926
"please, I need to live."

574
00:37:44,996 --> 00:37:47,988
It was the please
that caught my memory.

575
00:37:48,065 --> 00:37:50,499
I asked him
what was so important.

576
00:37:50,568 --> 00:37:52,900
"True love," he replied.

577
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:57,631
Then he spoke of a girl...

578
00:37:57,708 --> 00:37:59,608
of surpassing beauty
and faithfulness.

579
00:37:59,677 --> 00:38:02,111
I can only assume he meant you.

580
00:38:02,179 --> 00:38:03,874
You should bless me
for destroying him...

581
00:38:03,981 --> 00:38:06,814
before he found out
what you really are.

582
00:38:06,884 --> 00:38:08,181
And what am I?

583
00:38:08,252 --> 00:38:09,651
Faithfulness he talked of,
madam...

584
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,880
your enduring faithfulness.

585
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:12,889
Tell me truly. When you
found out he was gone...

586
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:14,390
did you get engaged
to your prince that same hour...

587
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:16,517
or did you wait a whole week
out of respect for the dead?

588
00:38:16,594 --> 00:38:18,926
You mocked me once.
Never do it again!

589
00:38:18,996 --> 00:38:20,827
I died that day!

590
00:38:24,935 --> 00:38:26,903
You can die, too,
for all I care!

591
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:31,604
As... you... wish!

592
00:38:31,676 --> 00:38:33,940
My sweet Westley.

593
00:38:34,011 --> 00:38:36,309
What have I done?

594
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:57,361
They've disappeared.

595
00:38:57,435 --> 00:38:59,869
He must've seen us closing in...

596
00:38:59,937 --> 00:39:02,371
which might account
for his panicking into error.

597
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:05,375
Unless I'm wrong,
and I am never wrong...

598
00:39:05,443 --> 00:39:08,412
they are headed
dead into the Fire Swamp.

599
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:21,424
Can you move at all?

600
00:39:21,492 --> 00:39:24,427
Move? You're alive.

601
00:39:24,495 --> 00:39:26,963
If you want, I can fly.

602
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:33,932
I told you
I would always come for you.

603
00:39:34,004 --> 00:39:36,302
Why didn't you wait for me?

604
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:37,932
Well...

605
00:39:38,008 --> 00:39:39,771
you were dead.

606
00:39:39,844 --> 00:39:41,869
Death cannot stop true love.

607
00:39:43,781 --> 00:39:46,079
All it can do is delay it
for a while.

608
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:49,746
I will never doubt again.

609
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:53,153
There will never be a need.

610
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,528
Oh, no. No, please.

611
00:39:58,596 --> 00:40:00,689
What is it? What's the matter?

612
00:40:00,765 --> 00:40:02,494
They're kissing again.

613
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:05,262
Do we have to hear
the kissing part?

614
00:40:05,336 --> 00:40:07,736
Someday you may not
mind so much.

615
00:40:07,805 --> 00:40:11,172
Skip on to the Fire Swamp.
That sounded good.

616
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:15,511
You're sick. I'll humor you.

617
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:18,047
So now, where were we here?

618
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:25,855
Westley and Buttercup
raced along the ravine floor.

619
00:40:27,124 --> 00:40:29,319
Your pig fiancé is too late.

620
00:40:31,295 --> 00:40:34,128
A few more steps, and we'll
be safe in the Fire Swamp.

621
00:40:34,198 --> 00:40:36,063
We'll never survive.

622
00:40:36,133 --> 00:40:39,762
Nonsense! You only say that
because no one ever has.

623
00:41:06,564 --> 00:41:08,725
It's not that bad.

624
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:13,330
I'm not saying I'd like
to build a summer home here...

625
00:41:13,404 --> 00:41:15,395
but the trees
are actually quite lovely.

626
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:56,202
Well, now,
that was an adventure.

627
00:41:56,313 --> 00:41:58,372
Singed a bit, were you?

628
00:41:58,482 --> 00:41:59,574
You?

629
00:42:06,557 --> 00:42:09,025
One thing I will say...

630
00:42:09,093 --> 00:42:13,553
the fire swamp certainly does
keep you on your toes.

631
00:42:17,668 --> 00:42:21,035
This will all soon be
but a happy memory...

632
00:42:21,105 --> 00:42:23,869
because Roberts' ship Revenge
is anchored at the far end...

633
00:42:23,941 --> 00:42:26,034
and I, as you know, am Roberts.

634
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:27,372
How is that possible...

635
00:42:27,444 --> 00:42:29,036
since he's been
marauding twenty years...

636
00:42:29,113 --> 00:42:31,581
and you only left me
five years ago?

637
00:42:31,649 --> 00:42:36,052
I myself am often surprised
at life's little quirks.

638
00:42:36,153 --> 00:42:41,090
What I told you before
about saying please was true.

639
00:42:41,158 --> 00:42:42,591
It intrigued Roberts...

640
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:45,595
as did my description
of your beauty.

641
00:42:45,663 --> 00:42:47,597
Finally,
Roberts decided something.

642
00:42:47,665 --> 00:42:51,465
He said, "All right, Westley,
I've never had a valet.

643
00:42:51,535 --> 00:42:53,469
"You can try it for tonight.

644
00:42:53,537 --> 00:42:55,971
"I'll most likely kill you
in the morning."

645
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,974
Three years he said that.

646
00:42:58,042 --> 00:43:00,169
"Good night, Westley,
good work. Sleep well.

647
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:02,474
"I'll most likely kill you
in the morning."

648
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,013
It was a fine time for me.

649
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:07,482
I was learning to fence, fight,
anything anyone would teach me.

650
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:09,519
And Roberts and I
eventually became friends...

651
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:11,521
and then it happened.

652
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:13,648
What? Go on.

653
00:43:13,724 --> 00:43:17,023
Roberts had grown so rich,
he wanted to retire...

654
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:20,996
so he took me to his cabin
and told me his secret.

655
00:43:21,065 --> 00:43:23,533
"I am not the Dread Pirate
Roberts," he said.

656
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:25,831
"My name is Ryan.

657
00:43:25,903 --> 00:43:28,565
"I inherited the ship
from the previous Roberts...

658
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:30,573
"just as you will inherit it
from me.

659
00:43:30,641 --> 00:43:33,735
"The man I inherited it from
wasn't the real Roberts, either.

660
00:43:33,811 --> 00:43:35,540
"His name was Cumberbund.

661
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:38,582
"The real Roberts has been
retired fifteen years...

662
00:43:38,649 --> 00:43:40,344
"and living like a king."
Thank you.

663
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:43,079
Then he explained the name
was the important thing...

664
00:43:43,153 --> 00:43:45,087
for inspiring
the necessary fear.

665
00:43:45,155 --> 00:43:48,989
You see, no one would surrender
to the Dread Pirate Westley.

666
00:43:49,059 --> 00:43:52,460
So we sailed ashore,
took on an entirely new crew.

667
00:43:52,529 --> 00:43:54,963
And he stayed aboard
for a while as first mate...

668
00:43:55,032 --> 00:43:56,465
all the time calling me Roberts.

669
00:43:56,533 --> 00:43:58,967
Once the crew believed,
he left the ship...

670
00:43:59,036 --> 00:44:00,970
and I have been Roberts
ever since.

671
00:44:01,038 --> 00:44:03,006
Except,
now that we're together...

672
00:44:03,073 --> 00:44:05,507
I shall retire and hand the name
over to someone else.

673
00:44:05,576 --> 00:44:07,476
Is everything clear to you?

674
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:42,963
We'll never succeed.

675
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,474
We may as well die here.

676
00:45:48,178 --> 00:45:51,079
No, we have already succeeded.

677
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:56,349
I mean, what are the three
terrors of the Fire Swamp?

678
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:59,480
One, the flame spurt.
No problem.

679
00:45:59,556 --> 00:46:01,421
There's a popping sound
preceding each.

680
00:46:01,492 --> 00:46:03,426
We can avoid that.

681
00:46:03,494 --> 00:46:04,927
Two, the lightning sand.

682
00:46:04,995 --> 00:46:06,929
But you were clever enough to
discover what that looks like...

683
00:46:06,997 --> 00:46:09,192
so in the future,
we can avoid that, too.

684
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:11,530
Westley,
what about the R.O.U.S. S?

685
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:12,933
Rodents of Unusual Size?

686
00:46:13,003 --> 00:46:15,198
I don't think they exist.

687
00:48:06,483 --> 00:48:08,417
We did it.

688
00:48:09,987 --> 00:48:12,182
Now, was that so terrible?

689
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:24,825
Surrender!

690
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:26,733
You mean you wish to surrender
to me?

691
00:48:26,803 --> 00:48:27,963
Very well. I accept.

692
00:48:28,038 --> 00:48:30,438
I give you full marks
for bravery.

693
00:48:30,507 --> 00:48:32,532
Don't make yourself a fool.

694
00:48:32,609 --> 00:48:33,735
But how will you capture us?

695
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:35,437
We know the secrets
of the Fire Swamp.

696
00:48:35,512 --> 00:48:37,480
We can live there quite happily
for some time...

697
00:48:37,547 --> 00:48:39,708
so whenever you feel like dying,
feel free to visit.

698
00:48:39,816 --> 00:48:42,979
I tell you once again,
surrender!

699
00:48:43,053 --> 00:48:44,520
It will not happen.

700
00:48:44,621 --> 00:48:46,782
For the last time, surrender!

701
00:48:46,857 --> 00:48:48,154
Death first!

702
00:48:48,225 --> 00:48:50,090
Will you promise
not to hurt him?!

703
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,628
- What was that?
- What was that?

704
00:48:52,696 --> 00:48:55,859
If we surrender
and I return with you...

705
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:59,266
will you promise
not to hurt this man?

706
00:48:59,336 --> 00:49:02,897
May I live a thousand years
and never hunt again.

707
00:49:02,973 --> 00:49:05,908
He is a sailor
on the pirate ship Revenge.

708
00:49:05,976 --> 00:49:08,308
Promise to return him
to his ship.

709
00:49:08,378 --> 00:49:10,903
I swear it will be done.

710
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:15,050
Once we're out of sight,
take him back to Florin...

711
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:17,450
and throw him
in the Pit of Despair.

712
00:49:17,521 --> 00:49:20,149
I swear it will be done.

713
00:49:20,223 --> 00:49:25,092
I thought you were dead once,
and it almost destroyed me.

714
00:49:25,162 --> 00:49:27,653
I could not bear it
if you died again...

715
00:49:27,731 --> 00:49:30,529
not when I could save you.

716
00:49:42,446 --> 00:49:43,879
Come, sir.

717
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:46,211
We must get you to your ship.

718
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:54,924
We are men of action.

719
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:57,290
Lies do not become us.

720
00:49:57,361 --> 00:50:00,524
Well spoken, sir.

721
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:09,066
What is it?

722
00:50:09,139 --> 00:50:11,505
You have six fingers
on your right hand.

723
00:50:11,575 --> 00:50:13,941
Someone was looking for you.

724
00:50:59,189 --> 00:51:00,520
Where am I?

725
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:03,081
The Pit of Despair.

726
00:51:03,193 --> 00:51:04,490
Don't even think...

727
00:51:07,697 --> 00:51:10,131
Don't even think about
trying to escape.

728
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:12,191
The chains are far too thick.

729
00:51:12,302 --> 00:51:14,896
And don't dream
of being rescued, either.

730
00:51:14,971 --> 00:51:16,939
The only way in is secret.

731
00:51:17,007 --> 00:51:18,838
Only the prince,
the count, and I...

732
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:21,139
know how to get in and out.

733
00:51:21,211 --> 00:51:23,111
Then I'm here till I die?

734
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:29,853
Till they kill you, yeah.

735
00:51:29,853 --> 00:51:31,912
Then why bother curing me?

736
00:51:31,988 --> 00:51:35,082
The prince and count insist
on everyone being healthy...

737
00:51:35,158 --> 00:51:36,625
before they're broken.

738
00:51:36,693 --> 00:51:38,183
So it's to be torture.

739
00:51:39,496 --> 00:51:41,726
I can cope with torture.

740
00:51:43,366 --> 00:51:45,800
You don't believe me?

741
00:51:45,869 --> 00:51:48,099
You survived the Fire Swamp.

742
00:51:48,171 --> 00:51:50,036
You must be very brave...

743
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:53,270
but nobody
withstands the Machine.

744
00:52:07,657 --> 00:52:10,558
She's been like that
ever since the Fire Swamp.

745
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:15,064
It's my father's failing health
that's upsetting her.

746
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:16,599
Of course.

747
00:52:18,301 --> 00:52:22,067
The king died that very night...

748
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:24,573
and before the following dawn...

749
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:27,201
Buttercup and Humperdinck
were married.

750
00:52:27,277 --> 00:52:29,507
And at noon,
she met her subjects again...

751
00:52:29,613 --> 00:52:31,478
this time, as their queen.

752
00:52:31,548 --> 00:52:34,016
My father's final words were...

753
00:52:34,117 --> 00:52:36,051
Hold it! Hold it, Grandpa.

754
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:37,552
You read that wrong.

755
00:52:37,621 --> 00:52:40,215
She doesn't marry Humperdinck.
She marries Westley.

756
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:41,587
I'm just sure of it.

757
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:43,683
After all that Westley
did for her...

758
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:46,729
if she didn't marry him,
it wouldn't be fair.

759
00:52:46,796 --> 00:52:48,559
Who says life is fair?

760
00:52:48,632 --> 00:52:49,997
Where is that written?

761
00:52:50,066 --> 00:52:52,091
Life isn't always fair.

762
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:54,637
I'm telling you,
you're messing up the story!

763
00:52:54,704 --> 00:52:56,171
Now, get it right!

764
00:52:56,239 --> 00:52:58,469
Do you want me
to go on with this?

765
00:52:59,576 --> 00:53:02,010
All right, then,
no more interruptions.

766
00:53:02,078 --> 00:53:04,546
"At noon,
she met her subjects again...

767
00:53:04,614 --> 00:53:06,741
this time, as their queen."

768
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:10,047
My father's final words were...

769
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:15,649
"Love her as I loved her,
and there will be joy."

770
00:53:15,725 --> 00:53:18,717
I present to you your queen!

771
00:53:18,795 --> 00:53:22,356
Queen Buttercup!

772
00:53:39,916 --> 00:53:41,349
Why do you do this?

773
00:53:41,418 --> 00:53:45,286
You had love in your hands,
and you gave it up!

774
00:53:45,355 --> 00:53:47,823
They would have killed Westley
if I hadn't done it.

775
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:50,985
Your true love lives,
and you marry another!

776
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:54,497
True love saved her
in the Fire Swamp...

777
00:53:54,564 --> 00:53:56,498
and she treated it like garbage!

778
00:53:56,566 --> 00:54:00,297
And that's what she is...
the Queen of Refuse!

779
00:54:00,370 --> 00:54:03,100
So bow down to her if you want!
Bow to her!

780
00:54:03,173 --> 00:54:05,505
Bow to the Queen of Slime!

781
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:07,008
The Queen of Filth!

782
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:09,136
The Queen of Putrescence!

783
00:54:11,448 --> 00:54:15,851
Rubbish! Filth! Slime! Muck!

784
00:54:22,125 --> 00:54:23,922
It was ten days
till the wedding.

785
00:54:23,994 --> 00:54:25,791
The king still lived.

786
00:54:25,862 --> 00:54:29,195
But Buttercup's nightmares
were growing steadily worse.

787
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:32,633
See? Didn't I say she'd never
marry that rotten Humperdinck?

788
00:54:32,702 --> 00:54:34,761
Yes, you're very smart.
Shut up.

789
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:36,496
It comes to this.

790
00:54:36,573 --> 00:54:39,736
I love Westley. I always have.

791
00:54:39,809 --> 00:54:42,141
I know now I always will.

792
00:54:42,212 --> 00:54:45,306
If you tell me I must marry you
in ten days...

793
00:54:45,415 --> 00:54:47,906
please believe
I will be dead by morning.

794
00:54:54,557 --> 00:54:57,993
I could never cause you grief.

795
00:54:58,061 --> 00:55:00,029
Consider our wedding off.

796
00:55:01,464 --> 00:55:03,830
You returned this...

797
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:06,027
Westley to his ship?

798
00:55:07,070 --> 00:55:09,402
Then we will simply alert him.

799
00:55:09,472 --> 00:55:16,344
Beloved... are you certain
he still wants you?

800
00:55:16,446 --> 00:55:20,576
After all, it was you who did
the leaving in the Fire Swamp.

801
00:55:20,684 --> 00:55:25,018
Not to mention that pirates are
not known as men of their words.

802
00:55:25,088 --> 00:55:27,522
My Westley
will always come for me.

803
00:55:34,064 --> 00:55:36,055
I suggest a deal.

804
00:55:36,132 --> 00:55:39,226
You write four copies
of a letter.

805
00:55:39,302 --> 00:55:42,669
I'll send my four fastest ships,
one in each direction.

806
00:55:42,739 --> 00:55:43,967
The Dread Pirate Roberts...

807
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:46,031
is always close to Florin
this time of year.

808
00:55:46,109 --> 00:55:48,942
We'll run up the white flag
and deliver your message.

809
00:55:49,045 --> 00:55:52,310
If Westley wants you,
bless you both.

810
00:55:52,415 --> 00:55:54,679
If not...

811
00:55:58,088 --> 00:56:01,751
please consider me
as an alternative to suicide.

812
00:56:01,825 --> 00:56:04,055
Are we agreed?

813
00:56:07,564 --> 00:56:11,466
Your princess is really
quite a winning creature.

814
00:56:11,534 --> 00:56:14,128
A trifle simple, perhaps,
but her appeal is undeniable.

815
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:16,297
I know. The people
are quite taken with her.

816
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:19,706
It's odd,
but when I hired Vizzini...

817
00:56:19,776 --> 00:56:21,573
to have her murdered
on our engagement day...

818
00:56:21,644 --> 00:56:22,770
I thought that was clever.

819
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:24,346
But it's going to be
so much more moving...

820
00:56:24,447 --> 00:56:26,972
when I strangle her
on our wedding night.

821
00:56:27,083 --> 00:56:28,482
Once Guilder is blamed...

822
00:56:28,551 --> 00:56:30,451
the nation
will be truly outraged.

823
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:32,818
They'll demand we go to war.

824
00:56:35,592 --> 00:56:39,028
Now, where is that secret knot?

825
00:56:39,095 --> 00:56:41,359
It's impossible to find.

826
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:46,967
Are you coming down
into the pit?

827
00:56:47,036 --> 00:56:48,526
Westley's got his strength back.

828
00:56:48,605 --> 00:56:51,039
I'm starting him
on the Machine tonight.

829
00:56:51,107 --> 00:56:54,770
Tyrone, you know how much
I love watching you work...

830
00:56:54,844 --> 00:56:58,336
but I've got my country's
500th anniversary to plan...

831
00:56:58,448 --> 00:57:00,848
my wedding to arrange,
my wife to murder...

832
00:57:00,917 --> 00:57:04,284
and Guilder to frame for it.
I'm swamped.

833
00:57:07,290 --> 00:57:09,019
Get some rest.

834
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:11,993
If you haven't got your health,
you haven't got anything.

835
00:57:28,545 --> 00:57:30,035
Beautiful, isn't it?

836
00:57:30,146 --> 00:57:34,446
It took me half a lifetime
to invent it.

837
00:57:34,517 --> 00:57:35,984
I'm sure you've discovered...

838
00:57:36,085 --> 00:57:38,713
my deep and abiding interest
in pain.

839
00:57:38,788 --> 00:57:40,312
At present, I'm writing
the definitive work...

840
00:57:40,390 --> 00:57:41,948
on the subject.

841
00:57:42,025 --> 00:57:44,118
So I want you to be
totally honest with me...

842
00:57:44,194 --> 00:57:46,355
on how the Machine
makes you feel.

843
00:57:46,429 --> 00:57:50,991
This being our first try,
I'll use the lowest setting.

844
00:58:26,536 --> 00:58:29,471
As you know, the concept
of the suction pump...

845
00:58:29,539 --> 00:58:31,241
is centuries old.

846
00:58:31,241 --> 00:58:33,471
Well, really,
that's all this is.

847
00:58:33,543 --> 00:58:35,909
Except that,
instead of sucking water...

848
00:58:35,979 --> 00:58:37,970
I'm sucking life.

849
00:58:38,047 --> 00:58:41,539
I've just sucked
one year of your life away.

850
00:58:41,618 --> 00:58:44,644
I might one day
go as high as five...

851
00:58:44,721 --> 00:58:47,485
but I really don't know
what that would do to you...

852
00:58:47,557 --> 00:58:49,718
so let's just start
with what we have.

853
00:58:49,792 --> 00:58:53,057
What did this do to you?
Tell me.

854
00:58:53,129 --> 00:58:54,926
And remember,
this is for posterity...

855
00:58:54,998 --> 00:58:56,431
so be honest.

856
00:58:56,499 --> 00:58:58,592
How do you feel?

857
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:04,506
Interesting.

858
00:59:15,051 --> 00:59:16,143
Yellin.

859
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:17,652
Sire.

860
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:31,959
As chief enforcer of all Florin,
I trust you with this secret.

861
00:59:32,068 --> 00:59:33,535
Killers from Guilder...

862
00:59:33,636 --> 00:59:35,194
are infiltrating
the Thieves' Forest...

863
00:59:35,305 --> 00:59:40,004
and plan to murder my bride
on our wedding night.

864
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:42,874
My spy network
has heard no such news.

865
00:59:42,946 --> 00:59:44,277
Any word from Westley?

866
00:59:46,082 --> 00:59:48,448
Too soon, my angel.

867
00:59:48,518 --> 00:59:49,917
Patience.

868
00:59:49,986 --> 00:59:51,248
He will come for me.

869
00:59:51,321 --> 00:59:53,118
Of course.

870
00:59:57,594 --> 00:59:59,528
She will not be murdered.

871
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:00,858
On the day of the wedding...

872
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:02,522
I want the Thieves' Forest
emptied...

873
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:05,295
and every inhabitant arrested.

874
01:00:05,401 --> 01:00:07,028
Many of the thieves will resist.

875
01:00:07,136 --> 01:00:09,764
My regular enforcers
will be inadequate.

876
01:00:09,872 --> 01:00:11,965
Form a brute squad, then!

877
01:00:12,075 --> 01:00:15,101
I want the Thieves' Forest
emptied before I wed.

878
01:00:15,178 --> 01:00:16,805
It won't be easy, sire.

879
01:00:16,879 --> 01:00:19,040
Try ruling the world sometime.

880
01:00:23,653 --> 01:00:26,019
The day of the wedding arrived.

881
01:00:26,089 --> 01:00:29,024
The brute squad
had their hands full...

882
01:00:29,092 --> 01:00:31,026
carrying out
Humperdinck's orders.

883
01:00:31,094 --> 01:00:33,528
Up! Up! Up!

884
01:00:33,596 --> 01:00:36,929
Come on! Come on!

885
01:00:37,033 --> 01:00:38,466
- Is everybody out?
- Almost.

886
01:00:38,534 --> 01:00:40,525
There's a Spaniard
giving us some trouble.

887
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:42,867
Well, you give him some trouble.

888
01:00:44,007 --> 01:00:45,099
Move.

889
01:00:49,345 --> 01:00:51,506
I am waiting for you, Vizzini.

890
01:00:51,581 --> 01:00:57,178
You told me to go back
to the beginning, so I have.

891
01:00:57,253 --> 01:01:01,587
This is where I am,
and this is where I'll stay.

892
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:04,252
I will not be moved.

893
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:05,658
Ho there!

894
01:01:05,728 --> 01:01:09,061
I do not budge.
Keep your "ho there."

895
01:01:09,132 --> 01:01:10,690
The prince gave orders.

896
01:01:13,770 --> 01:01:15,328
So did Vizzini.

897
01:01:15,438 --> 01:01:17,804
When a job went wrong,
you went back to the beginning.

898
01:01:17,874 --> 01:01:21,640
This is where we got the job,
so it's the beginning.

899
01:01:21,711 --> 01:01:23,679
And I am staying
till Vizzini come.

900
01:01:23,746 --> 01:01:25,145
You brute, come here!

901
01:01:25,214 --> 01:01:30,652
I am waiting for Vizzini.

902
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:33,188
You surely are a meanie.

903
01:01:42,231 --> 01:01:43,926
It's you.

904
01:01:44,033 --> 01:01:45,728
True.

905
01:01:47,336 --> 01:01:49,167
You don't look so good.

906
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:53,335
You don't smell so good, either.

907
01:01:53,409 --> 01:01:55,138
Perhaps not.

908
01:01:55,211 --> 01:01:57,008
I feel fine.

909
01:02:01,184 --> 01:02:03,709
Fezzik and Inigo were reunited.

910
01:02:03,786 --> 01:02:07,222
As Fezzik nursed his inebriated
friend back to health...

911
01:02:07,290 --> 01:02:09,554
he told Inigo
of Vizzini's death...

912
01:02:09,625 --> 01:02:11,217
and the existence
of Count Rugen...

913
01:02:11,294 --> 01:02:12,556
the six-fingered man.

914
01:02:12,628 --> 01:02:15,119
Considering Inigo's
lifelong search...

915
01:02:15,198 --> 01:02:17,689
he handled the news
surprisingly well.

916
01:02:20,269 --> 01:02:23,261
Fezzik took great care
in reviving Inigo.

917
01:02:23,372 --> 01:02:24,771
That's enough!

918
01:02:26,542 --> 01:02:29,943
Where is this Rugen now
so I may kill him?

919
01:02:30,012 --> 01:02:32,173
He's with the prince
in the castle...

920
01:02:32,248 --> 01:02:35,274
but the castle gate
is guarded by thirty men.

921
01:02:39,422 --> 01:02:41,652
How many could you handle?

922
01:02:41,724 --> 01:02:43,851
I don't think more than ten.

923
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:50,255
Leaving twenty for me.

924
01:02:51,734 --> 01:02:53,929
At my best,
I could never defeat that many.

925
01:02:57,473 --> 01:03:00,874
I need Vizzini to plan.
I have no gift for strategy.

926
01:03:00,943 --> 01:03:02,604
But Vizzini is dead.

927
01:03:02,678 --> 01:03:06,671
No. Not Vizzini.

928
01:03:06,749 --> 01:03:09,081
I need the man in black.

929
01:03:09,152 --> 01:03:10,312
What?

930
01:03:10,386 --> 01:03:13,184
He bested you with strength,
your greatness.

931
01:03:13,256 --> 01:03:15,190
He bested me with steel.

932
01:03:15,258 --> 01:03:17,692
He must have
out-thought Vizzini.

933
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:22,288
A man who can do that can plan
my castle onslaught any day.

934
01:03:22,365 --> 01:03:23,423
- Let's go.
- Where?

935
01:03:23,499 --> 01:03:25,433
Find the man in black,
obviously.

936
01:03:25,501 --> 01:03:26,798
But you don't know where he is.

937
01:03:26,903 --> 01:03:28,336
Don't bother me with trifles.

938
01:03:28,437 --> 01:03:29,495
After twenty years, at last...

939
01:03:29,605 --> 01:03:31,630
my father's soul
will be at peace.

940
01:03:31,741 --> 01:03:33,675
There will be blood tonight!

941
01:03:44,153 --> 01:03:46,417
Rise and report.

942
01:03:46,489 --> 01:03:48,320
The Thieves' Forest is emptied.

943
01:03:48,391 --> 01:03:49,551
Thirty men
guard the castle gate.

944
01:03:49,625 --> 01:03:51,183
Double it.

945
01:03:51,260 --> 01:03:53,057
My princess must be safe.

946
01:03:53,129 --> 01:03:55,597
The gate has but one key...

947
01:03:55,665 --> 01:03:58,964
and I carry that.

948
01:04:02,672 --> 01:04:04,606
My dulcet darling!

949
01:04:06,776 --> 01:04:08,869
Tonight, we marry.

950
01:04:08,945 --> 01:04:12,312
Tomorrow morning, your men will
escort us to Florin Channel...

951
01:04:12,381 --> 01:04:14,611
where every ship in my armada...

952
01:04:14,684 --> 01:04:17,653
waits to accompany us
on our honeymoon.

953
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:20,245
Every ship
but your four fastest, you mean.

954
01:04:22,758 --> 01:04:25,124
Every ship
but the four you sent.

955
01:04:25,194 --> 01:04:27,059
Yes, of course.

956
01:04:27,129 --> 01:04:29,154
Naturally, not those four.

957
01:04:30,733 --> 01:04:32,826
Your Majesties.

958
01:04:36,572 --> 01:04:38,540
You never sent the ships.

959
01:04:38,641 --> 01:04:41,166
Don't bother lying.

960
01:04:41,244 --> 01:04:42,609
It doesn't matter.

961
01:04:42,678 --> 01:04:44,646
Westley will come for me,
anyway.

962
01:04:44,714 --> 01:04:46,545
You're a silly girl.

963
01:04:46,616 --> 01:04:48,106
Yes, I am a silly girl...

964
01:04:48,184 --> 01:04:51,244
for not having seen sooner that
you were nothing but a coward...

965
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:53,413
with a heart full of fear.

966
01:04:53,489 --> 01:04:58,222
I would not say such things
if I were you.

967
01:04:58,294 --> 01:05:01,058
Why not? You can't hurt me.

968
01:05:01,130 --> 01:05:05,157
Westley and I are joined
by the bonds of love...

969
01:05:05,268 --> 01:05:07,065
and you cannot track that...

970
01:05:07,169 --> 01:05:09,831
not with
a thousand bloodhounds...

971
01:05:09,939 --> 01:05:12,100
and you cannot break it...

972
01:05:12,174 --> 01:05:14,108
not with a thousand swords.

973
01:05:14,176 --> 01:05:16,110
And when I say
you are a coward...

974
01:05:16,178 --> 01:05:18,112
that is only because you are
the slimiest weakling...

975
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:20,171
ever to crawl the earth.

976
01:05:22,218 --> 01:05:26,211
I would not say such things
if I were you!

977
01:05:40,670 --> 01:05:42,604
You truly love each other...

978
01:05:42,672 --> 01:05:44,606
and so you might have been
truly happy.

979
01:05:44,707 --> 01:05:46,937
Not one couple in a century
has that chance...

980
01:05:47,009 --> 01:05:49,068
no matter what
the storybooks say.

981
01:05:49,145 --> 01:05:52,080
So I think
no man in a century...

982
01:05:52,148 --> 01:05:55,140
will suffer as greatly
as you will.

983
01:05:58,354 --> 01:05:59,548
Not to fifty!

984
01:06:22,712 --> 01:06:25,381
Listen. Do you hear?

985
01:06:25,381 --> 01:06:27,611
That is the sound
of ultimate suffering.

986
01:06:27,683 --> 01:06:31,642
My heart made that sound when
Rugen slaughtered my father.

987
01:06:31,721 --> 01:06:33,348
The man in black makes it now.

988
01:06:33,422 --> 01:06:34,650
The man in black?

989
01:06:34,724 --> 01:06:36,521
His true love
is marrying another tonight.

990
01:06:36,592 --> 01:06:38,890
Who else has the cause
for ultimate suffering?

991
01:06:38,961 --> 01:06:42,089
Excuse me.
Pardon me, it's important.

992
01:06:42,164 --> 01:06:43,631
Fezzik, please.

993
01:06:43,699 --> 01:06:45,189
Everybody, move!

994
01:06:45,301 --> 01:06:46,666
Thank you.

995
01:06:55,111 --> 01:06:57,705
Where is the man in black?

996
01:06:57,780 --> 01:06:59,975
You get there
from this grove, yes?

997
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:03,580
Fezzik, jog his memory.

998
01:07:08,090 --> 01:07:10,058
I'm sorry, Inigo.

999
01:07:10,126 --> 01:07:13,027
I didn't mean
to jog him so hard.

1000
01:07:16,232 --> 01:07:21,568
Father, I have failed you
for twenty years.

1001
01:07:21,637 --> 01:07:24,105
Now our misery can end.

1002
01:07:24,173 --> 01:07:26,038
Somewhere...

1003
01:07:26,108 --> 01:07:31,011
somewhere close by
is a man who can help us.

1004
01:07:31,113 --> 01:07:34,048
I cannot find him alone.

1005
01:07:34,116 --> 01:07:37,051
I need you.

1006
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:40,054
I need you to guide my sword.

1007
01:07:40,122 --> 01:07:41,612
Please.

1008
01:07:43,125 --> 01:07:45,593
Guide my sword.

1009
01:08:35,611 --> 01:08:37,238
He's dead.

1010
01:08:37,313 --> 01:08:39,747
It just is not fair.

1011
01:08:39,815 --> 01:08:41,646
Grandpa, wait!

1012
01:08:41,717 --> 01:08:46,211
Wait. What did Fezzik mean,
"He's dead"?

1013
01:08:46,288 --> 01:08:48,984
I mean, he didn't mean dead.

1014
01:08:49,058 --> 01:08:52,550
Westley's only faking... right?

1015
01:08:52,628 --> 01:08:55,290
You want me to read this or not?

1016
01:08:55,364 --> 01:08:57,559
Who gets Humperdinck?

1017
01:08:57,633 --> 01:08:59,464
I don't understand.

1018
01:08:59,535 --> 01:09:02,504
Who kills Prince Humperdinck
at the end?

1019
01:09:02,571 --> 01:09:04,539
Somebody's got to do it.

1020
01:09:04,607 --> 01:09:05,869
Is it Inigo? Who?

1021
01:09:05,975 --> 01:09:09,001
Nobody. Nobody kills him.

1022
01:09:09,111 --> 01:09:10,442
He lives.

1023
01:09:10,513 --> 01:09:12,037
You mean he wins?

1024
01:09:12,148 --> 01:09:15,311
Jesus, Grandpa, what did you
read me this thing for?

1025
01:09:15,384 --> 01:09:17,079
You've been very sick...

1026
01:09:17,153 --> 01:09:20,589
and you're taking this story
very seriously.

1027
01:09:20,656 --> 01:09:23,591
I think we ought to stop now.

1028
01:09:23,659 --> 01:09:25,650
No. I'm OK.

1029
01:09:25,728 --> 01:09:28,561
Sit down. I'm all right.

1030
01:09:30,132 --> 01:09:33,329
All right, now,
let's see, where were we?

1031
01:09:36,138 --> 01:09:38,072
In the Pit of Despair.

1032
01:09:42,878 --> 01:09:44,573
We Montoyas
have never taken defeat easily.

1033
01:09:44,647 --> 01:09:47,172
Come along, Fezzik.
Bring the body.

1034
01:09:47,249 --> 01:09:48,739
The body?

1035
01:09:48,817 --> 01:09:50,546
Have you any money?

1036
01:09:50,619 --> 01:09:51,881
I have a little.

1037
01:09:51,954 --> 01:09:55,981
I just hope it's enough
to buy a miracle, that's all.

1038
01:10:00,162 --> 01:10:01,789
Go away!

1039
01:10:04,934 --> 01:10:06,333
What? What?

1040
01:10:06,402 --> 01:10:07,494
Are you the Miracle Max...

1041
01:10:07,570 --> 01:10:09,265
who worked for the king
all those years?

1042
01:10:09,338 --> 01:10:11,101
The king's stinking son
fired me.

1043
01:10:11,207 --> 01:10:14,142
And thank you for bringing up
such a painful subject.

1044
01:10:14,243 --> 01:10:16,177
While you're at it, why don't
you give me a nice paper cut...

1045
01:10:16,278 --> 01:10:17,540
and pour lemon juice on it?

1046
01:10:17,613 --> 01:10:18,739
We're closed!

1047
01:10:22,551 --> 01:10:24,246
Beat it,
or I'll call the brute squad.

1048
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:25,719
I'm on the brute squad.

1049
01:10:25,788 --> 01:10:27,415
You are the brute squad.

1050
01:10:27,489 --> 01:10:29,753
We need a miracle.
It's very important.

1051
01:10:29,825 --> 01:10:31,918
Look, I'm retired.
And besides...

1052
01:10:31,994 --> 01:10:34,462
why would you want someone
the king's stinking son fired?

1053
01:10:34,530 --> 01:10:36,691
I might kill whoever
you wanted me to miracle.

1054
01:10:36,765 --> 01:10:38,096
He's already dead.

1055
01:10:38,167 --> 01:10:39,657
He is, huh?

1056
01:10:39,735 --> 01:10:42,499
I'll take a look. Bring him in.

1057
01:10:55,718 --> 01:10:57,686
I've seen worse.

1058
01:11:03,225 --> 01:11:04,351
Sir?

1059
01:11:07,062 --> 01:11:09,087
We're in a terrible rush.

1060
01:11:09,164 --> 01:11:10,256
Don't rush me, sonny.

1061
01:11:10,332 --> 01:11:12,664
You rush a miracle man,
you get rotten miracles.

1062
01:11:12,735 --> 01:11:14,202
You got money?

1063
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:15,430
Sixty-five.

1064
01:11:15,504 --> 01:11:18,166
I never worked for so little...

1065
01:11:18,274 --> 01:11:20,902
except once,
and that was a very noble cause.

1066
01:11:21,010 --> 01:11:23,171
This is noble, sir.

1067
01:11:23,245 --> 01:11:25,179
His wife is crippled.

1068
01:11:25,281 --> 01:11:29,980
His children
are on the brink of starvation.

1069
01:11:30,052 --> 01:11:32,350
Are you a rotten liar!

1070
01:11:32,421 --> 01:11:34,548
I need him
to help avenge my father...

1071
01:11:34,623 --> 01:11:36,284
murdered these twenty years.

1072
01:11:36,358 --> 01:11:39,088
Your first story was better.
Where's that bellows?

1073
01:11:39,161 --> 01:11:42,392
He probably owes you money, huh?
Well, I'll ask him.

1074
01:11:42,464 --> 01:11:44,022
He's dead. He can't talk.

1075
01:11:44,099 --> 01:11:46,693
Look who knows so much, huh?

1076
01:11:46,769 --> 01:11:51,638
It just so happens your friend
is only mostly dead.

1077
01:11:51,740 --> 01:11:55,608
There's a big difference between
mostly dead and all dead.

1078
01:11:55,678 --> 01:11:57,339
Please open his mouth.

1079
01:11:57,413 --> 01:12:02,180
Now, mostly dead
is slightly alive.

1080
01:12:02,251 --> 01:12:04,811
Now, all dead...
well, with all dead...

1081
01:12:04,887 --> 01:12:07,447
there's usually only one thing
that you can do.

1082
01:12:07,523 --> 01:12:08,854
What's that?

1083
01:12:08,924 --> 01:12:11,722
Go through his clothes
and look for loose change.

1084
01:12:18,334 --> 01:12:20,199
Hello in there!

1085
01:12:20,269 --> 01:12:22,703
What's so important?

1086
01:12:22,805 --> 01:12:25,706
What you got here
that's worth living for?

1087
01:12:30,245 --> 01:12:32,679
Tr-u-u-ue lo-o-o-ove.

1088
01:12:32,748 --> 01:12:34,648
True love. You heard him?

1089
01:12:34,717 --> 01:12:36,844
You could not ask for
a more noble cause than that.

1090
01:12:36,919 --> 01:12:38,181
Hey, sonny...

1091
01:12:38,253 --> 01:12:40,221
true love is the greatest thing
in the world...

1092
01:12:40,289 --> 01:12:42,519
except for a nice M.L. T...

1093
01:12:42,591 --> 01:12:44,183
mutton, lettuce,
and tomato sandwich...

1094
01:12:44,259 --> 01:12:48,093
when the mutton is nice and lean
and the tomato is ripe.

1095
01:12:48,163 --> 01:12:49,425
They're so perky. I love that.

1096
01:12:49,498 --> 01:12:50,692
But that's not what he said.

1097
01:12:50,766 --> 01:12:53,599
He distinctly said,
"To bl-a-a-ave."

1098
01:12:53,669 --> 01:12:56,160
And as we all know,
to blave means to bluff, huh?

1099
01:12:56,271 --> 01:12:58,705
So you were probably playing
cards, and he cheated...

1100
01:12:58,774 --> 01:13:02,039
Liar!

1101
01:13:02,111 --> 01:13:03,169
Get back, witch!

1102
01:13:03,278 --> 01:13:04,677
I'm not a witch! I'm your wife!

1103
01:13:04,747 --> 01:13:06,180
But after what you just said...

1104
01:13:06,248 --> 01:13:08,478
I'm not even sure
I want to be that anymore!

1105
01:13:08,550 --> 01:13:10,017
You never had it so good.

1106
01:13:10,085 --> 01:13:11,484
He said true love, Max.

1107
01:13:11,553 --> 01:13:12,850
Don't say another word, Valerie!

1108
01:13:12,921 --> 01:13:14,013
He's afraid.

1109
01:13:14,089 --> 01:13:15,716
Ever since Prince Humperdinck
fired him...

1110
01:13:15,791 --> 01:13:17,019
his confidence is shattered.

1111
01:13:17,092 --> 01:13:18,218
Why'd you say that name?

1112
01:13:18,293 --> 01:13:20,318
You promised me that
you would never say that name!

1113
01:13:20,396 --> 01:13:22,694
What? Humperdinck?

1114
01:13:26,402 --> 01:13:27,960
I'm not listening!

1115
01:13:28,036 --> 01:13:29,503
A life expiring...

1116
01:13:29,605 --> 01:13:32,165
and you don't have the decency
to say why you won't help!

1117
01:13:32,274 --> 01:13:34,708
- Nobody's hearing nothing!
- Humperdinck!

1118
01:13:34,777 --> 01:13:36,677
This is Buttercup's true love.

1119
01:13:36,745 --> 01:13:39,407
If you heal him, he will stop
Humperdinck's wedding.

1120
01:13:39,481 --> 01:13:41,472
Shut up!
Wait a minute.

1121
01:13:41,550 --> 01:13:43,518
I make him better,
Humperdinck suffers?

1122
01:13:43,585 --> 01:13:46,315
Humiliations galore!

1123
01:13:49,858 --> 01:13:51,348
That is a noble cause.

1124
01:13:51,427 --> 01:13:54,328
Give me the sixty-five.
I'm on the job.

1125
01:13:58,033 --> 01:13:59,830
That's a miracle pill?

1126
01:13:59,902 --> 01:14:02,598
The chocolate coating
makes it go down easier...

1127
01:14:02,671 --> 01:14:05,936
but you have to wait 15 minutes
for full potency...

1128
01:14:06,041 --> 01:14:09,204
and you shouldn't go swimming
for at least, what?

1129
01:14:09,278 --> 01:14:11,712
- An hour. A good hour.
- Yeah, an hour.

1130
01:14:11,780 --> 01:14:13,475
Thank you for everything.

1131
01:14:13,549 --> 01:14:14,880
Bye-bye, boys.

1132
01:14:14,950 --> 01:14:16,884
Have fun storming the castle.

1133
01:14:16,952 --> 01:14:18,385
Think it'll work?

1134
01:14:18,454 --> 01:14:20,115
It would take a miracle.

1135
01:14:30,132 --> 01:14:31,258
Anything?

1136
01:14:33,702 --> 01:14:36,796
Inigo, there's more than thirty.

1137
01:14:36,872 --> 01:14:39,136
What's the difference?

1138
01:14:39,241 --> 01:14:41,175
We've got him.

1139
01:14:41,243 --> 01:14:42,710
Help me here.

1140
01:14:42,811 --> 01:14:44,836
We'll have to force-feed him.

1141
01:14:44,947 --> 01:14:46,380
Has it been fifteen minutes?

1142
01:14:46,482 --> 01:14:48,677
We can't wait.
The wedding's in half an hour.

1143
01:14:48,750 --> 01:14:51,218
We must strike in the hustle
and bustle beforehand.

1144
01:14:51,286 --> 01:14:52,617
Tilt his head back.

1145
01:14:52,688 --> 01:14:55,452
Open his mouth.

1146
01:14:58,994 --> 01:15:01,189
How long do we have to wait...

1147
01:15:01,263 --> 01:15:02,924
before if we know
the miracle works?

1148
01:15:02,998 --> 01:15:04,625
Your guess is as good as mine.

1149
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:07,100
I'll beat you apart!
I'll take you both together!

1150
01:15:07,169 --> 01:15:09,069
I guess not very long.

1151
01:15:10,205 --> 01:15:12,173
Why won't my arms move?

1152
01:15:12,274 --> 01:15:14,071
You've been mostly dead all day.

1153
01:15:14,176 --> 01:15:17,839
We had Miracle Max
make a pill to bring you back.

1154
01:15:17,946 --> 01:15:19,675
Who are you?

1155
01:15:19,748 --> 01:15:21,045
Are we enemies?

1156
01:15:21,116 --> 01:15:22,640
Why am I on this wall?

1157
01:15:22,718 --> 01:15:24,015
Where's Buttercup?

1158
01:15:24,086 --> 01:15:25,383
Let me explain.

1159
01:15:25,454 --> 01:15:27,422
No, there is too much.
Let me sum up.

1160
01:15:27,489 --> 01:15:30,219
Buttercup's marrying Humperdinck
in less than half an hour...

1161
01:15:30,292 --> 01:15:32,886
so all we have to do is get in,
break up the wedding...

1162
01:15:32,961 --> 01:15:34,656
steal the princess,
make our escape...

1163
01:15:34,730 --> 01:15:36,527
after I kill Count Rugen.

1164
01:15:36,598 --> 01:15:38,623
That doesn't leave much time
for dilly-dallying.

1165
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:40,827
You just wiggled your finger!

1166
01:15:40,903 --> 01:15:42,370
That's wonderful!

1167
01:15:42,437 --> 01:15:44,064
I've always been a quick healer.

1168
01:15:44,139 --> 01:15:45,367
What are our liabilities?

1169
01:15:45,474 --> 01:15:47,738
There is but one
working castle gate.

1170
01:15:47,843 --> 01:15:48,935
Come on.

1171
01:15:50,712 --> 01:15:54,842
And it is guarded
by sixty men.

1172
01:15:54,917 --> 01:15:56,350
And our assets?

1173
01:15:56,418 --> 01:15:58,886
Your brains, Fezzik's strength,
my steel.

1174
01:15:58,954 --> 01:16:00,319
That's it?

1175
01:16:00,389 --> 01:16:01,651
Lmpossible.

1176
01:16:01,723 --> 01:16:03,657
If I had a month to plan...

1177
01:16:03,725 --> 01:16:05,989
maybe I could come up
with something, but this...

1178
01:16:06,061 --> 01:16:07,722
You just shook your head!

1179
01:16:07,796 --> 01:16:09,491
That doesn't make you happy?

1180
01:16:12,601 --> 01:16:14,831
My brains, his steel...

1181
01:16:14,903 --> 01:16:16,894
and your strength
against sixty men...

1182
01:16:16,972 --> 01:16:20,430
and a little head jiggle
is supposed to make me happy?

1183
01:16:21,710 --> 01:16:25,339
If we only had a wheelbarrow,
that would be something.

1184
01:16:25,414 --> 01:16:27,780
Where did we put the wheelbarrow
the albino had?

1185
01:16:27,849 --> 01:16:29,510
Over the albino, I think.

1186
01:16:29,585 --> 01:16:33,681
Why didn't you list that among
our assets in the first place?

1187
01:16:35,390 --> 01:16:37,449
What I wouldn't give
for a holocaust cloak.

1188
01:16:37,526 --> 01:16:39,153
There we cannot help you.

1189
01:16:40,228 --> 01:16:41,718
Will this do?

1190
01:16:41,797 --> 01:16:44,265
- Where did you get that?
- At Miracle Max's.

1191
01:16:44,333 --> 01:16:46,528
It fit so nice,
he said I could keep it.

1192
01:16:46,602 --> 01:16:48,763
All right. Come on, help me up.

1193
01:16:51,239 --> 01:16:52,706
I'll need a sword eventually.

1194
01:16:52,808 --> 01:16:54,605
Why? You can't even lift one.

1195
01:16:54,710 --> 01:16:57,144
True, but that's hardly
common knowledge, is it?

1196
01:16:57,245 --> 01:16:58,644
Thank you.

1197
01:16:58,714 --> 01:17:01,649
There may be problems
once we're inside.

1198
01:17:01,717 --> 01:17:04,379
I'll say.
How do I find the count?

1199
01:17:04,453 --> 01:17:05,784
Once I do,
how do I find you again?

1200
01:17:05,854 --> 01:17:07,185
Once I find you again,
how do we escape?

1201
01:17:07,255 --> 01:17:08,654
Don't pester him.

1202
01:17:08,724 --> 01:17:10,885
He's had a hard day.

1203
01:17:10,959 --> 01:17:13,189
Right, right. Sorry.

1204
01:17:16,999 --> 01:17:19,160
- Inigo.
- What?

1205
01:17:19,234 --> 01:17:21,168
I hope we win.

1206
01:17:21,236 --> 01:17:24,171
You don't seem excited,
my little muffin.

1207
01:17:24,239 --> 01:17:25,604
Should I be?

1208
01:17:25,707 --> 01:17:28,642
Brides often are, I'm told.

1209
01:17:28,710 --> 01:17:30,541
I do not marry tonight.

1210
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:33,677
My Westley will save me.

1211
01:18:26,168 --> 01:18:28,102
Marriage...

1212
01:18:28,170 --> 01:18:33,665
Marriage is what brings us
together... today.

1213
01:18:33,775 --> 01:18:35,140
Marriage...

1214
01:18:35,210 --> 01:18:38,543
that blessed arrangement...

1215
01:18:38,613 --> 01:18:43,073
that dream within a dream...

1216
01:18:43,151 --> 01:18:44,413
Stand your ground, men!

1217
01:18:53,295 --> 01:18:57,288
I am the Dread Pirate Roberts.

1218
01:18:58,633 --> 01:19:02,000
There will be no survivor!

1219
01:19:02,070 --> 01:19:04,095
- Now?
- Not yet.

1220
01:19:04,172 --> 01:19:06,299
My men are here.

1221
01:19:06,408 --> 01:19:08,842
I am here...

1222
01:19:08,944 --> 01:19:12,846
but soon you will not be here.

1223
01:19:12,914 --> 01:19:14,711
- Now?
- Light him.

1224
01:19:17,719 --> 01:19:19,778
The Dread Pirate Roberts...

1225
01:19:19,855 --> 01:19:22,653
takes no survivors.

1226
01:19:22,724 --> 01:19:25,557
All your worst nightmares...

1227
01:19:25,627 --> 01:19:28,824
are about to come true.

1228
01:19:28,897 --> 01:19:30,865
Then love...

1229
01:19:30,932 --> 01:19:33,400
true love...

1230
01:19:33,468 --> 01:19:35,595
will follow you...

1231
01:19:35,670 --> 01:19:38,161
forever.

1232
01:19:38,273 --> 01:19:40,935
The Dread Pirate Roberts...

1233
01:19:41,042 --> 01:19:44,978
is here for your souls!

1234
01:19:46,782 --> 01:19:48,215
Stay where you are!

1235
01:19:48,316 --> 01:19:50,250
Fight!

1236
01:19:50,318 --> 01:19:52,786
Stay where you are!

1237
01:19:56,758 --> 01:19:59,249
So treasure your love.

1238
01:19:59,327 --> 01:20:01,090
Skip to the end.

1239
01:20:01,163 --> 01:20:03,222
Have you the ring?

1240
01:20:04,833 --> 01:20:06,858
Here comes my Westley now.

1241
01:20:06,935 --> 01:20:09,597
Fezzik, the portcullis!

1242
01:20:14,810 --> 01:20:17,108
Your Westley is dead.

1243
01:20:17,179 --> 01:20:18,441
I killed him myself.

1244
01:20:18,513 --> 01:20:21,209
Then why is there fear
behind your eyes?

1245
01:20:25,287 --> 01:20:27,016
Give us the gate key.

1246
01:20:27,088 --> 01:20:29,113
I have no gate key.

1247
01:20:29,191 --> 01:20:31,785
Fezzik, tear his arms off.

1248
01:20:31,860 --> 01:20:34,795
You mean this gate key?

1249
01:20:34,863 --> 01:20:37,764
...and do you,
Princess Buttercup...

1250
01:20:37,833 --> 01:20:40,768
Man and wife!
Say man and wife!

1251
01:20:40,836 --> 01:20:42,804
Man and wife.

1252
01:20:42,871 --> 01:20:45,066
Escort the bride
to the honeymoon suite.

1253
01:20:45,140 --> 01:20:47,870
I'll be there shortly.

1254
01:20:48,944 --> 01:20:51,071
He didn't come.

1255
01:21:24,846 --> 01:21:27,144
Kill the dark one
and the giant...

1256
01:21:27,215 --> 01:21:29,479
but leave the third
for questioning.

1257
01:21:42,197 --> 01:21:45,030
My name is Inigo Montoya.

1258
01:21:45,100 --> 01:21:47,568
You killed my father.

1259
01:21:47,669 --> 01:21:50,035
Prepare to die.

1260
01:22:14,696 --> 01:22:16,163
I need you!

1261
01:22:16,231 --> 01:22:18,426
I can't leave him alone.

1262
01:22:18,533 --> 01:22:20,592
He's getting away from me,
Fezzik!

1263
01:22:20,702 --> 01:22:21,999
Please!

1264
01:22:27,275 --> 01:22:29,266
I'll be right back.

1265
01:22:36,785 --> 01:22:38,252
Thank you.

1266
01:22:39,354 --> 01:22:41,219
Strange wedding.

1267
01:22:41,289 --> 01:22:44,725
Yes... a very strange wedding.

1268
01:22:44,793 --> 01:22:46,283
Come along.

1269
01:22:52,567 --> 01:22:54,091
What was that for?

1270
01:22:54,202 --> 01:22:56,534
Because you've always been
so kind to me.

1271
01:22:56,604 --> 01:22:58,538
And I won't be seeing you
again...

1272
01:22:58,640 --> 01:23:01,575
since I'm killing myself once
we reach the honeymoon suite.

1273
01:23:01,643 --> 01:23:03,736
Won't that be nice?

1274
01:23:03,812 --> 01:23:05,279
She kissed me!

1275
01:23:52,127 --> 01:23:54,595
Sorry, Father.

1276
01:23:55,797 --> 01:23:58,027
I tried.

1277
01:24:01,002 --> 01:24:03,027
You must be
that little Spanish brat...

1278
01:24:03,138 --> 01:24:06,539
I taught a lesson to
all those years ago.

1279
01:24:06,641 --> 01:24:08,575
Simply incredible.

1280
01:24:08,643 --> 01:24:10,611
Have you been chasing me
your whole life...

1281
01:24:10,678 --> 01:24:12,578
only to fail now?

1282
01:24:12,647 --> 01:24:15,775
I think that's the worst thing
I've ever heard.

1283
01:24:17,285 --> 01:24:19,116
How marvelous.

1284
01:24:56,224 --> 01:24:58,158
There's a shortage of
perfect breasts in this world.

1285
01:24:58,226 --> 01:25:01,127
It would be a pity
to damage yours.

1286
01:25:02,630 --> 01:25:04,188
Oh, Westley, darling!

1287
01:25:07,268 --> 01:25:10,066
Westley, why won't you hold me?

1288
01:25:10,138 --> 01:25:11,230
Gently.

1289
01:25:11,306 --> 01:25:13,240
At a time like this...

1290
01:25:13,308 --> 01:25:16,243
that's all you can think to say,
gently?

1291
01:25:16,311 --> 01:25:18,279
Gently!

1292
01:25:31,159 --> 01:25:35,186
Good heavens,
are you still trying to win?

1293
01:25:37,499 --> 01:25:41,367
You've got an overdeveloped
sense of vengeance.

1294
01:25:41,436 --> 01:25:44,371
It's going to get you
into trouble someday.

1295
01:25:58,987 --> 01:26:01,717
My name is Inigo Montoya.

1296
01:26:01,789 --> 01:26:04,622
You killed my father.

1297
01:26:04,692 --> 01:26:06,159
Prepare to die.

1298
01:26:13,768 --> 01:26:16,635
My name is Inigo Montoya.

1299
01:26:16,704 --> 01:26:18,797
You killed my father.

1300
01:26:18,873 --> 01:26:20,670
Prepare to die.

1301
01:26:24,279 --> 01:26:27,043
Hello!
My name is Inigo Montoya.

1302
01:26:27,115 --> 01:26:30,050
You killed my father.
Prepare to die.

1303
01:26:30,118 --> 01:26:32,211
Stop saying that!

1304
01:26:36,224 --> 01:26:38,124
Hello!
My name is Inigo Montoya!

1305
01:26:38,193 --> 01:26:40,024
You killed my father!

1306
01:26:40,094 --> 01:26:41,755
Prepare to die!

1307
01:26:41,863 --> 01:26:43,160
Offer me money.

1308
01:26:44,232 --> 01:26:46,063
Power, too, promise me that.

1309
01:26:46,134 --> 01:26:49,001
All that I have and more,
please.

1310
01:26:49,103 --> 01:26:51,936
Offer me everything I ask for.

1311
01:26:52,006 --> 01:26:54,031
Anything you want.

1312
01:26:56,244 --> 01:26:59,771
I want my father back,
you son of a bitch!

1313
01:27:14,162 --> 01:27:16,130
Westley,
will you ever forgive me?

1314
01:27:16,231 --> 01:27:18,825
What hideous sin
have you committed lately?

1315
01:27:18,900 --> 01:27:22,529
I got married. I didn't want to.
It all happened so fast.

1316
01:27:22,637 --> 01:27:25,401
It never happened.
It never happened.

1317
01:27:25,473 --> 01:27:26,770
But it did. I was there.

1318
01:27:26,841 --> 01:27:28,240
This old man said man and wife.

1319
01:27:28,309 --> 01:27:30,004
Did you say I do?

1320
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:34,074
We sort of skipped that part.

1321
01:27:34,148 --> 01:27:35,581
Then you're not married.

1322
01:27:35,650 --> 01:27:39,711
If you didn't say it,
you didn't do it.

1323
01:27:39,787 --> 01:27:42,347
Wouldn't you agree,
Your Highness?

1324
01:27:42,423 --> 01:27:45,950
A technicality
that will shortly be remedied.

1325
01:27:47,495 --> 01:27:49,725
But first things first.

1326
01:27:51,199 --> 01:27:52,666
To the death.

1327
01:27:54,135 --> 01:27:55,625
To the pain.

1328
01:27:57,605 --> 01:27:59,197
I don't think I'm quite familiar
with that phrase.

1329
01:27:59,307 --> 01:28:00,899
I'll explain...

1330
01:28:01,009 --> 01:28:04,740
and I'll use small words so that
you'll be sure to understand...

1331
01:28:04,812 --> 01:28:06,939
you warthog-faced buffoon.

1332
01:28:08,316 --> 01:28:10,750
That may be the first time
in my life...

1333
01:28:10,818 --> 01:28:13,446
a man has dared insult me.

1334
01:28:13,521 --> 01:28:15,148
It won't be the last.

1335
01:28:15,223 --> 01:28:17,657
To the pain means
the first thing you lose...

1336
01:28:17,725 --> 01:28:19,716
will be your feet
below the ankles...

1337
01:28:19,794 --> 01:28:22,228
then your hands at the wrists...

1338
01:28:22,297 --> 01:28:23,730
next your nose.

1339
01:28:23,798 --> 01:28:25,732
And then my tongue, I suppose.

1340
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:28,234
I killed you
too quickly the last time...

1341
01:28:28,336 --> 01:28:30,634
a mistake I don't mean
to duplicate tonight.

1342
01:28:30,705 --> 01:28:32,172
I wasn't finished.

1343
01:28:32,273 --> 01:28:35,174
The next thing you lose will be
your left eye, then your right.

1344
01:28:35,243 --> 01:28:38,576
And then my ears. I understand!
Let's get on with it!

1345
01:28:38,646 --> 01:28:41,945
Wrong! Your ears you keep,
and I'll tell you why...

1346
01:28:43,918 --> 01:28:47,217
so every shriek of every child
at seeing your hideousness...

1347
01:28:47,288 --> 01:28:49,119
will be yours to cherish.

1348
01:28:49,190 --> 01:28:51,852
Every babe that weeps
at your approach...

1349
01:28:51,926 --> 01:28:55,293
every woman who cries out,
"God, what is that thing"...

1350
01:28:55,363 --> 01:28:58,127
will echo in your perfect ears.

1351
01:28:58,199 --> 01:29:01,168
That is what
"to the pain" means.

1352
01:29:01,235 --> 01:29:04,170
It means I leave you
in anguish...

1353
01:29:04,238 --> 01:29:07,639
wallowing
in freakish misery forever.

1354
01:29:08,743 --> 01:29:10,802
I think you're bluffing.

1355
01:29:10,878 --> 01:29:12,277
It's possible, pig!

1356
01:29:12,347 --> 01:29:14,281
I might be bluffing.

1357
01:29:14,349 --> 01:29:18,046
It's conceivable,
you miserable vomitous mass...

1358
01:29:18,119 --> 01:29:21,680
I'm only lying here because
I lack the strength to stand.

1359
01:29:21,756 --> 01:29:23,815
Then again...

1360
01:29:25,193 --> 01:29:28,128
perhaps I have the strength
after all.

1361
01:29:43,845 --> 01:29:47,941
Drop your sword.

1362
01:29:51,219 --> 01:29:52,948
Have a seat.

1363
01:29:57,392 --> 01:29:58,825
Tie him up.

1364
01:30:00,027 --> 01:30:02,825
Make it as tight as you like.

1365
01:30:06,868 --> 01:30:08,301
Where's Fezzik?

1366
01:30:08,403 --> 01:30:10,894
I thought he was with you.

1367
01:30:11,005 --> 01:30:12,666
In that case...

1368
01:30:12,774 --> 01:30:13,832
Help him.

1369
01:30:13,941 --> 01:30:15,806
Why does Westley need helping?

1370
01:30:15,877 --> 01:30:18,209
Because he has no strength.

1371
01:30:18,279 --> 01:30:20,270
I knew you were bluffing!
I knew he was bluffing.

1372
01:30:20,348 --> 01:30:23,044
- Shall I dispatch him for you?
- Thank you, but no.

1373
01:30:23,117 --> 01:30:24,379
Whatever happens to us...

1374
01:30:24,452 --> 01:30:26,545
I want him to live a long life,
alone with his cowardice.

1375
01:30:28,523 --> 01:30:32,289
Inigo, where are you?

1376
01:30:32,360 --> 01:30:35,193
There you are.

1377
01:30:35,263 --> 01:30:37,823
Inigo,
I saw the prince's stables...

1378
01:30:37,899 --> 01:30:40,993
and there they were,
four white horses.

1379
01:30:41,102 --> 01:30:43,332
And I thought,
there are four of us...

1380
01:30:43,438 --> 01:30:45,372
if we ever find the lady.

1381
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:46,805
Hello, lady.

1382
01:30:48,342 --> 01:30:51,641
So I took them with me in case
we ever bumped into each other.

1383
01:30:51,712 --> 01:30:54,112
I guess we just did.

1384
01:30:55,383 --> 01:30:57,351
You did something right.

1385
01:30:57,418 --> 01:31:00,444
Don't worry.
I won't let it go to my head.

1386
01:31:19,373 --> 01:31:20,806
You know...

1387
01:31:20,875 --> 01:31:22,809
it's very strange.

1388
01:31:22,877 --> 01:31:26,335
I have been in the revenge
business so long...

1389
01:31:26,414 --> 01:31:28,348
now that it's over...

1390
01:31:28,416 --> 01:31:31,385
I don't know what to do
with the rest of my life.

1391
01:31:32,420 --> 01:31:34,684
Have you ever considered piracy?

1392
01:31:34,755 --> 01:31:36,950
You'd make a wonderful
Dread Pirate Roberts.

1393
01:31:49,570 --> 01:31:51,094
They rode to freedom.

1394
01:31:51,205 --> 01:31:54,766
And as dawn arose, Westley and
Buttercup knew they were safe.

1395
01:31:54,876 --> 01:31:57,970
A wave of love swept over them.

1396
01:31:58,045 --> 01:32:00,741
And as they reached
for each other...

1397
01:32:02,884 --> 01:32:04,317
What? What?

1398
01:32:04,385 --> 01:32:07,548
It's kissing again.
You don't want to hear that.

1399
01:32:07,622 --> 01:32:11,114
I don't mind so much.

1400
01:32:15,863 --> 01:32:17,854
Since the invention
of the kiss...

1401
01:32:17,932 --> 01:32:19,559
there have been five kisses...

1402
01:32:19,634 --> 01:32:21,329
that were rated
the most passionate...

1403
01:32:21,435 --> 01:32:23,369
the most pure.

1404
01:32:23,437 --> 01:32:25,837
This one left them all behind.

1405
01:32:30,344 --> 01:32:31,868
The end.

1406
01:32:34,916 --> 01:32:37,350
Now I think
you ought to go to sleep.

1407
01:32:49,797 --> 01:32:51,731
All right.

1408
01:32:54,802 --> 01:32:56,235
