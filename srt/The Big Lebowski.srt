to the ground

3
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:43,576
NARRATOR: Way out West
there was this fella.

4
00:00:43,577 --> 00:00:46,012
Fella I wanna tell you about.

5
00:00:46,013 --> 00:00:49,548
Fella by the name
of Jeff Lebowski.

6
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:53,252
£east that was the handle
that his loving parents
gave him.

7
00:00:53,253 --> 00:00:56,389
But he never had
much use for it himself.

8
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:00,526
This Lebowski,
he called himself the Dude.

9
00:01:00,527 --> 00:01:02,662
Now Dude,

10
00:01:02,663 --> 00:01:06,432
that's a name no one would
self-apply where I come from.

11
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:11,904
But then there was a lot about
the Dude that didn't make
a whole lot of sense to me,

12
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:14,640
and a lot about
where he lived likewise.

13
00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:16,909
Drifting along with
the tumbling tumbleweeds

14
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,578
NARRATOR: But then again,

15
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:21,747
maybe that's why
I found the place
so darned interesting.

16
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,783
I know when night has gone

17
00:01:23,784 --> 00:01:26,752
That a new world's
born at dawn

18
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:30,856
NARRATOR:
They call Los Angeles
the City of Angels.

19
00:01:30,857 --> 00:01:33,993
I didn't find it to be that,
exactly.

20
00:01:33,994 --> 00:01:37,797
But I'll allow there are
some nice folks there.

21
00:01:37,798 --> 00:01:40,566
Course, I can't say
I seen London,

22
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:42,902
and I never been to France,

23
00:01:42,903 --> 00:01:48,007
and I ain't never seen no
queen in her damned undies,
as the fella says.

24
00:01:48,008 --> 00:01:50,009
But I'll tell you what,

25
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:55,381
after seeing Los Angeles
and this here story
I'm about to unfold,

26
00:01:55,382 --> 00:01:58,317
well, I guess
I've seen something

27
00:01:58,318 --> 00:02:02,588
every bit as stupefying
as you can see in any of
those other places,

28
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:04,824
and in English, too.

29
00:02:04,825 --> 00:02:07,827
So I can die with
a smile on my face

30
00:02:07,828 --> 00:02:10,627
without feeling like
the good Lord gypped me.

31
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,733
Now, this here story
I'm about to unfold

32
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:16,836
took place back
in the early '9·s,

33
00:02:16,837 --> 00:02:21,774
just about the time
of our conflict with
Saddam and the lraqis.

34
00:02:21,775 --> 00:02:25,444
I only mention it 'cause
sometimes there's a man...

35
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:27,546
I won't say a hero.

36
00:02:27,547 --> 00:02:29,682
'Cause what's a hero?

37
00:02:29,683 --> 00:02:32,084
But sometimes there's a man...

38
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:35,187
And I'm talking about
the Dude here.

39
00:02:35,188 --> 00:02:37,957
Sometimes there's a man...

40
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:42,628
Well, he's the man
for his time and place.

41
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:45,431
He fits right in there.

42
00:02:45,432 --> 00:02:48,834
And that's the Dude
in Los Angeles.

43
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:52,638
And even if he is a lazy man,

44
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:55,341
and the Dude was
most certainly that,

45
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:59,178
quite possibly the laziest
in Los Angeles county,

46
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:03,047
which would place him
high in the running
for laziest worldwide.

47
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:07,186
But sometimes there's a man...

48
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,986
Sometimes there's a man...

49
00:03:11,425 --> 00:03:14,927
Well, I lost my train
of thought here.

50
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:16,191
But...

51
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,598

enough.

wealth, obviously,
and the resources,

Yeah, but...

(WALTER CLEARS THROAT)

178
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:35,074
That rug really tied
the room together,
did it not?

179
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:37,075
Fucking A.
And this guy peed on it.

180
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:38,477
Donny, please.

181
00:09:38,478 --> 00:09:39,745
You know, this is
the fucking guy...

182
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:42,114
I could find this
fucking Lebowski guy.

183
00:09:42,115 --> 00:09:44,550
His name is Lebowski?
That's your name, Dude.

184
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:48,921
This is the guy who
should compensate me
for the fucking rug.

185
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:52,624
His wife goes out and
owes money all over town,
and they pee on my rug?

186
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,760
They pee on
your fucking rug?

187
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:57,457
Peed on my fucking rug.
That's right, Dude.

188
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:01,231
They peed on
your fucking rug.

189
00:10:02,836 --> 00:10:04,603
This is the study.

190
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,306
As you can see, the various
commendations, awards...

...citations, honorary
degrees, et cetera.

192
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:15,013
Very impressive.
Oh, please feel free
to inspect them.

193
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:17,716
Oh. No, I'm not really...
Oh, please. Please.

194
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:19,751
That is the key to
the city of Pasadena,

195
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:25,190
which Mr. Lebowski received
two years ago in recognition
of his various civic...

196
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:29,962
Oh! That's the Los Angeles
Chamber of Commerce
Business Achiever Award,

197
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:32,197
which is given...
Oh, not necessarily
given every year.

198
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:33,398
Hey, is this...

199
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:34,700
Given only when there's
a worthy somebody...

200
00:10:34,701 --> 00:10:36,068
Is this him with Nancy?

201
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:39,404
Yes, indeed,
that is Mr. Lebowski
with the first lady, yes.

202
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:40,706
It was taken
when Mrs. Reagan...

203
00:10:40,707 --> 00:10:43,442
That's Lebowski
on the left there?

204
00:10:43,443 --> 00:10:46,245
Of course. Mr. Lebowski,
on the left...
So he's a...

205
00:10:46,246 --> 00:10:48,914
You know, a handicapped
kind of guy?

206
00:10:48,915 --> 00:10:51,077
Mr. Lebowski is
disabled, yes.

207
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:55,020
This picture was taken
when Mrs. Reagan was
first lady of the nation.

208
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:56,188
Yes, yes.

209
00:10:56,189 --> 00:10:58,223
Not of California.
Good shot.

210
00:10:58,224 --> 00:11:00,526
In fact, he met privately
with the President,

211
00:11:00,527 --> 00:11:03,362
though, unfortunately,
there wasn't enough time
for a photo opportunity.

212
00:11:03,363 --> 00:11:05,397
Oh, Nancy's pretty good.
Oh, wonderful woman.

213
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:07,766
We were very happy to...
These are...

214
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:10,536
Oh, those are
Mr. Lebowski's
children, so to speak.

00:11:10,537 --> 00:11:11,904
Different mothers, huh?

216
00:11:11,905 --> 00:11:14,306

They're not literally
his children.

They're the Little Lebowski
Urban Achievers,

220
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:23,282
inner city children
of promise, but without
the necessary means for...

221
00:11:23,283 --> 00:11:25,384
Necessary means for
a higher education,

222
00:11:25,385 --> 00:11:28,887
so Mr. Lebowski is
committed to sending
all of them to college.

223
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:30,289
Excuse me.
Oh, geez.

224
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:32,191
Thank you. Thank you.

225
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:36,652
Far out. Think he's got
room for one more?
One... Oh.

226
00:11:38,298 --> 00:11:39,631
You never went to college.

227
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:41,767
Please, don't touch that.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
No, I did,

228
00:11:41,768 --> 00:11:44,136
but, you know,
I spent most of my time

229
00:11:44,137 --> 00:11:47,372
occupying various
administration buildings,

and bowling.

I don't remember most of it.

Well, sir,
it's this rug I have.

240
00:12:14,968 --> 00:12:17,069
It really tied
the room together.

241
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,838
You told Brandt
on the phone.
He told me.

242
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,364
Where do I fit in?

243
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:25,344
Well, they were looking
for you, these two guys.

244
00:12:25,345 --> 00:12:27,412
You know, they...
I'll say it again.

245
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:30,616
You told Brandt on the phone.
He told me.

246
00:12:30,617 --> 00:12:32,751
I know what happened.
Yes, yes.

247
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:36,054
Oh, so you know that
they were trying to
piss on your rug.

248
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:38,323
Did I urinate on your rug?

249
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:40,659
You mean, did you personally
come and pee on my rug?

No. Like I said,
Woo peed on my rug.

understand this, sir.

is micturated upon
in this fair city,

the person?

scam anybody here.

something to you.

will not stand, man.

My wife is not
the issue here!

00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:02,307
I hope that someday
my wife will learn to
live on her allowance,

280
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:03,775
which is ample.

281
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:06,712
But if she does not,
that is her problem,
not mine,

is your problem.

lot in life is his
own responsibility,

he chooses to blame.

for the loss of my legs.

to everything.

what your parents did!

00:27:04,556 --> 00:27:07,225
So, how much
did he give you?

511
00:27:07,226 --> 00:27:10,628
20 grand, man.
And, of course,
I still get to keep the rug.

512
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:12,029
Just for making
a hand-off?
Yeah.

They gave Dude a beeper.

514
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,302
So whenever
these guys call...
What if it's
during a game?

515
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:21,005
Oh, I told them
if it was during
league play...

516
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:22,206
What's during
league play?

517
00:27:22,207 --> 00:27:24,742

stop and start
at your convenience,

piece of shit.

00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:28,779

What's wrong with
Walter, Dude?

520
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:31,382
I figure
it's easy money, you know.
It's all pretty harmless.

521
00:27:31,383 --> 00:27:33,215
She probably
kidnapped herself.

522
00:27:34,186 --> 00:27:37,154
What do you mean, Dude?
Rug-peers did not do this.

523
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:42,093
Look at it. A young
trophy wife marries
this guy for his money.

524
00:27:42,094 --> 00:27:45,029
She figures he isn't
giving her enough,
you know.

all over town.

I'm trying to say.

I did not watch my buddies
die face down in the muck

542
00:28:25,237 --> 00:28:27,071
so that this
fucking strumpet,

543
00:28:27,072 --> 00:28:28,306

could waltz around...

with Vietnam, man.

there isn't any connection.

00:44:27,098 --> 00:44:28,998
Now, your face.

848
00:44:30,268 --> 00:44:32,168
As for this kidnapping.

849
00:44:32,303 --> 00:44:33,370
Huh?

850
00:44:33,371 --> 00:44:36,873
Yes, I know all about it,
and I know that you acted
as courier.

851
00:44:36,874 --> 00:44:40,210
Let me tell you something.
The whole thing stinks to
high heaven.

852
00:44:40,211 --> 00:44:44,514
Yeah, right, but let me
explain something about
the rug.

853
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:46,745
Do you like sex,
Mr. Lebowski?

854
00:44:47,718 --> 00:44:51,121
Excuse me?
Sex, the physical act
of love. Coitus.

855
00:44:51,122 --> 00:44:54,424
Do you like it?
I was talking
about my rug.

856
00:44:54,425 --> 00:44:57,027
You're not interested in sex?

857
00:44:57,028 --> 00:44:59,396
You mean coitus?
I like it, too.

858
00:44:59,397 --> 00:45:01,765
It's a male myth about
feminists that we hate sex.

859
00:45:01,766 --> 00:45:04,267
It can be a natural,
zesty enterprise.

860
00:45:04,268 --> 00:45:05,735
However, there are
some people,

861
00:45:05,736 --> 00:45:08,772
it is called
satyriasis in men,
nymphomania in women,

862
00:45:08,773 --> 00:45:12,008
who engage in it compulsively
and without joy.

863
00:45:12,009 --> 00:45:15,111
Oh, no.
Oh, yes, Mr. Lebowski.

864
00:45:15,112 --> 00:45:19,082
These unfortunate souls
cannot love, in the true
sense of the word.

865
00:45:19,083 --> 00:45:22,652
Our mutual acquaintance,
Bunny, is one of these.

866
00:45:22,653 --> 00:45:24,955
Listen, Maude,

867
00:45:24,956 --> 00:45:28,225
I'm sorry if your stepmother
is a nympho,

868
00:45:28,226 --> 00:45:31,695
but, you know, I don't see
what this has to do with...

869
00:45:31,696 --> 00:45:34,495
You have any Kahlua?
Take a look at this, sir.

870
00:45:38,035 --> 00:45:39,867
DUDE: Oh, I know that guy.

871
00:45:41,472 --> 00:45:43,668
He's a nihilist.

872
00:45:45,243 --> 00:45:47,077
"Karl Hungus."

873
00:45:47,078 --> 00:45:48,739
(lCE CUBES CLINKING)

874
00:46:00,725 --> 00:46:02,225
Hi.
Hello.

875
00:46:02,226 --> 00:46:05,262
Mein dispatcher says
there is something
wrong with dein Kabel.

876
00:46:05,263 --> 00:46:06,463
Yeah. Come on in.

877
00:46:06,464 --> 00:46:08,999
I'm not really sure
exactly what's really
wrong with the cable.

878
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,668
That's why they sent me.
I am an expert.

879
00:46:11,669 --> 00:46:13,036
The TV's in here.

880
00:46:13,037 --> 00:46:16,234
You recognize her,
of course.
Helga, bring my tools.

881
00:46:19,143 --> 00:46:20,977
That's my friend Sherry.

882
00:46:20,978 --> 00:46:22,746
She just came over
to use the shower.

883
00:46:22,747 --> 00:46:25,181
The story is ludicrous.

884
00:46:25,182 --> 00:46:28,218
My name is Karl.
lch bin expert.

885
00:46:28,219 --> 00:46:30,353
You must be here
to fix the cable.

886
00:46:30,354 --> 00:46:33,290
Lord, you can imagine
where it goes from here.

887
00:46:33,291 --> 00:46:34,824
He fixes the cable?

888
00:46:34,825 --> 00:46:36,960
Don't be fatuous, Jeffrey.

889
00:46:36,961 --> 00:46:40,330
Little matter to me that
this woman chose to pursue
a career in pornography,

890
00:46:40,331 --> 00:46:43,066
nor that she has been
banging Jackie Treehorn,

891
00:46:43,067 --> 00:46:44,901
to use the parlance
of our times.

892
00:46:44,902 --> 00:46:48,938
However,
I am one of the two trustees
of the Lebowski Foundation,

893
00:46:48,939 --> 00:46:50,674
the other being my father.

894
00:46:50,675 --> 00:46:52,742
The foundation takes
youngsters from Watts and...

895
00:46:52,743 --> 00:46:54,210
Shit, yeah. The achievers.

896
00:46:54,211 --> 00:46:57,981
Little Lebowski Urban
Achievers, yes, and proud
we are of all of them.

897
00:46:57,982 --> 00:47:01,918
I asked my father about
his withdrawal of $1 million
from the foundation account,

898
00:47:01,919 --> 00:47:03,820
and he told me
about this abduction,

899
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:05,555
but I tell you
it is preposterous.

900
00:47:05,556 --> 00:47:09,526
This compulsive fornicator
is taking my father for
the proverbial ride.

901
00:47:09,527 --> 00:47:11,561
Yeah, but my...
I'm getting to your rug.

902
00:47:11,562 --> 00:47:13,363
My father and l
don't get along.

903
00:47:13,364 --> 00:47:15,098
He doesn't approve
of my lifestyle and,

904
00:47:15,099 --> 00:47:16,833
needless to say,
I don't approve of his.

905
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:20,737
However, I hardly
wish to make my father's
embezzlement a police matter.

906
00:47:20,738 --> 00:47:23,673
So I'm proposing that you
try to recover the money

907
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:25,909
from the people
you delivered it to.

908
00:47:25,910 --> 00:47:28,878
Well, I could do that.

909
00:47:28,879 --> 00:47:30,847
If you successfully do so,

910
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:36,186
I will compensate you
to the tune of 10% of
the recovered sum.

911
00:47:36,187 --> 00:47:38,288
A hundred...
Thousand. Yes.

912
00:47:38,289 --> 00:47:41,124
Bones or clams or
whatever you call them.

913
00:47:41,125 --> 00:47:45,462
Yeah, but what about my...
Your rug, yes.

914
00:47:45,463 --> 00:47:48,131
Well, with that money
you can buy any
number of rugs

915
00:47:48,132 --> 00:47:50,834
that don't have sentimental
value for me.

916
00:47:50,835 --> 00:47:53,436
And I am sorry about
that crack on the jaw.

917
00:47:53,437 --> 00:47:55,972
Oh, that's fine.
That doesn't even...

918
00:47:55,973 --> 00:47:58,608
Here's the name and
number of a doctor who
will look at it for you.

919
00:47:58,609 --> 00:48:00,243
You will receive no bill.

920
00:48:00,244 --> 00:48:01,911
He's a good man
and thorough.

921
00:48:01,912 --> 00:48:03,613
(STUTTERS)
That's thoughtful but...

922
00:48:03,614 --> 00:48:07,107
Please see him, Jeffrey.
He's a good man and thorough.

923
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:10,881
Oh, well, all right.

924
00:48:11,922 --> 00:48:13,656
So he says, "My wife's
a pain in the ass.

925
00:48:13,657 --> 00:48:16,159
"She's always busting
my frigging agates.

926
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:19,429
"My daughter's married
to a loser bastard.

927
00:48:19,430 --> 00:48:23,399
"l got a rash
so bad on my ass
I can't even sit down.

928
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,668
"But you know me,
I can't complain."

929
00:48:25,669 --> 00:48:27,537
(LAUGHING)
Oh, fucking A, man.

930
00:48:27,538 --> 00:48:30,269
I got a rash, man. Fucking A.

931
00:48:31,342 --> 00:48:33,977
I gotta tell you, Tone, man,

932
00:48:33,978 --> 00:48:37,180
earlier today I was really
feeling shitty, man.

933
00:48:37,181 --> 00:48:39,182
Really down in the dumps.

934
00:48:39,183 --> 00:48:40,650
Lost a little money...

935
00:48:40,651 --> 00:48:44,154
Hey, you know what?
Forget about it, huh?
Forget about it.

936
00:48:44,155 --> 00:48:45,488
Yeah, fuck it, man.

937
00:48:45,489 --> 00:48:48,391
You can't be worried
about that shit.
Life goes on, man.

938
00:48:48,392 --> 00:48:51,089
Well, home, sweet home,
Mr. L.

939
00:48:53,831 --> 00:48:56,199
TONY: Hey, yo. Come here.

940
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:58,692
Who's your friend
in the Volkswagen?
Huh?

941
00:49:00,571 --> 00:49:02,872
TONY: Yeah.
He followed us here.

942
00:49:02,873 --> 00:49:05,875
When did he start...
Whoa! What the fuck?

943
00:49:05,876 --> 00:49:08,077
Get in the limo,
you son of a bitch!
No arguments!

944
00:49:08,078 --> 00:49:10,946
Hey! Hey! Careful, man!
There's a beverage here!

945
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:15,151
Start talking,
and talk fast,
you lousy bum.

946
00:49:15,152 --> 00:49:17,086
We've been frantically
trying to reach you, Dude.

947
00:49:17,087 --> 00:49:19,613
Where is my goddamn money,
you bum?

948
00:49:21,158 --> 00:49:23,960
Well, we... I don't...

949
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:26,329
They did not receive
the money, you nitwit!

950
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:28,031
They did not
receive the money!

951
00:49:28,032 --> 00:49:30,400
Her life was
in your hands!

952
00:49:30,401 --> 00:49:32,001
This is our concern, Dude.

953
00:49:32,002 --> 00:49:34,137
No, man.
Nothing is fucked here.

954
00:49:34,138 --> 00:49:36,139
Nothing is fucked?
No, man.

955
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:40,043
The goddamn plane
has crashed into
the mountain!

956
00:49:40,044 --> 00:49:44,347
Man, come on.
Who are you gonna
believe, those guys or...

957
00:49:44,348 --> 00:49:46,182
We dropped off the damn money.

958
00:49:46,183 --> 00:49:47,480
We?

959
00:49:48,786 --> 00:49:51,855
l, the royal we.

960
00:49:51,856 --> 00:49:53,289
You know. The editorial...

961
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:55,425
I dropped off the money
exactly as per...

962
00:49:55,426 --> 00:49:59,295
Look, man, I've got
certain information.
All right?

963
00:49:59,296 --> 00:50:01,865
Certain things have
come to light and...

964
00:50:01,866 --> 00:50:04,567
You know, has it ever
occurred to you

965
00:50:04,568 --> 00:50:10,106
that instead of, you know,
running around, blaming me...

966
00:50:10,107 --> 00:50:12,375
You know, given the nature
of all this new shit,

967
00:50:12,376 --> 00:50:18,314
you know, this could be
a lot more complex...

968
00:50:18,315 --> 00:50:23,353
I mean, it's not just...
It might not be just such
a simple... You know?

969
00:50:23,354 --> 00:50:26,956
What in God's holy name
are you blathering about?

970
00:50:26,957 --> 00:50:29,392
Well, I'll tell you what
I'm blathering about.

971
00:50:29,393 --> 00:50:31,427
I've got information, man.

972
00:50:31,428 --> 00:50:33,263
New shit has come to light.

973
00:50:33,264 --> 00:50:35,232
And, shit, man,

974
00:50:37,201 --> 00:50:39,101
she kidnapped herself.

975
00:50:42,139 --> 00:50:44,941
Well, sure, man.
Look at it. You know?

976
00:50:44,942 --> 00:50:48,978
A young trophy wife,
in the parlance of
our times, you know.

977
00:50:48,979 --> 00:50:54,145
She owes money
all over town, including
to known pornographers.

978
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:58,317
And that's cool.
That's cool.

979
00:50:59,189 --> 00:51:03,092
I'm saying she
needs money, man.

980
00:51:03,093 --> 00:51:06,757
And, you know,
of course they're gonna
say they didn't get it

981
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:10,967
because she wants more, man.

982
00:51:10,968 --> 00:51:13,403
She's gotta feed the monkey.
I mean...

983
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:18,908
Hasn't that ever
occurred to you, man?

984
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:19,967
Sir?

985
00:51:22,146 --> 00:51:25,615
No, Mr. Lebowski,
it had not occurred
to me.

986
00:51:25,616 --> 00:51:27,917
That had not
occurred to us, Dude.

987
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:29,452
Well, okay, you know?

988
00:51:29,453 --> 00:51:34,057
You guys aren't privy
to all the new shit,
so, you know...

989
00:51:34,058 --> 00:51:37,527
But, hey, that's what you...
That's what you pay me for.

990
00:51:37,528 --> 00:51:38,654
(CHUCKLES)

991
00:51:39,863 --> 00:51:41,064
Speaking of which,

992
00:51:41,065 --> 00:51:45,468
do you think that you could
give me my $20,000 in cash?

993
00:51:45,469 --> 00:51:48,538
My concern is, and
I've gotta check it
with my accountant,

994
00:51:48,539 --> 00:51:51,341
that this might bump me up
into a higher tax...

995
00:51:51,342 --> 00:51:53,936
Brandt, give him
the envelope.

996
00:51:54,645 --> 00:51:58,715
Oh, well, if you've
already got the check
made out, that's cool.

997
00:51:58,716 --> 00:52:00,707
BRANDT: We received this
this morning.

998
00:52:03,253 --> 00:52:06,723
Since you have
failed to achieve,

999
00:52:06,724 --> 00:52:10,293
even in the modest task
which was your charge,

1000
00:52:10,294 --> 00:52:13,563
since you have
stolen my money,

1001
00:52:13,564 --> 00:52:17,333
since you have
unrepentantly
betrayed my trust,

1002
00:52:17,334 --> 00:52:21,371
I have no choice
but to tell these bums

1003
00:52:21,372 --> 00:52:23,673
to do whatever is necessary

1004
00:52:23,674 --> 00:52:27,804
to recover their money
from you, Jeffrey Lebowski.

1005
00:52:29,079 --> 00:52:33,216
And with Brandt as my witness,
I will tell you this,

1006
00:52:33,217 --> 00:52:36,586
any further harm
visited upon Bunny

1007
00:52:36,587 --> 00:52:40,182
will be visited tenfold
upon your head.

1008
00:52:42,593 --> 00:52:44,026
By God, sir,

1009
00:52:44,561 --> 00:52:47,554
I will not abide another toe.

1010
00:52:48,198 --> 00:52:53,669
I hear the cottonwoods
whispering above

1011
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:55,798

from my special...

all pissed off.

he yelled at me a lot,

anything, huh?

it's a cathartic...
No, no.

I'm saying that
if he knows I'm a fuckup,

1690
01:35:28,756 --> 01:35:31,191
why does he leave me
in charge of getting
his wife back?

1691

fucking want her back, man.

He's had enough.
He no longer digs her.
It's all a show.

1693
01:35:37,899 --> 01:35:42,369
Okay, but then
why doesn't he give a shit
about his million bucks?

1694

handed off his briefcase,

for it back.

fucking empty, man.

He was one of us.

01:54:45,545 --> 01:54:49,778
So viva Las Vegas

2007
01:54:51,318 --> 01:54:55,380
Viva Las Vegas

2008
01:54:59,092 --> 01:55:03,829
Viva Las Vegas
with your neon flashing

2009
01:55:03,830 --> 01:55:06,866
And your one-arm
bandits crashing

2010
01:55:06,867 --> 01:55:10,462
All those hopes down the drain

2011
01:55:12,038 --> 01:55:17,309
Viva Las Vegas turnin'
day into nighttime

2012
01:55:17,310 --> 01:55:19,879
Night into daytime

2013
01:55:19,880 --> 01:55:22,148
If you see it once

2014
01:55:22,149 --> 01:55:28,554
You'll never be the same again

2015
01:55:30,624 --> 01:55:35,161
I'm gonna keep on
keep on runnin'

2016
01:55:35,162 --> 01:55:38,893
If it costs me
my very last dime

2017
01:55:40,433 --> 01:55:42,835
If I wind up broke

2018
01:55:42,836 --> 01:55:45,137
Well, I'll always remember

2019
01:55:45,138 --> 01:55:49,166
That I had a swingin' time

2020
01:55:51,011 --> 01:55:55,107
I'm gonna give it
everything I've got

2021
01:55:56,216 --> 01:56:00,448
Lady Luck, please
let the dice stay hot

2022
01:56:01,388 --> 01:56:05,991
£et me shoot a seven
on every shot

2023
01:56:05,992 --> 01:56:10,191
So viva Las Vegas

2024
01:56:11,731 --> 01:56:15,497
Viva Las Vegas

2025
01:56:16,870 --> 01:56:21,068
Viva Las Vegas

2026
01:56:21,942 --> 01:56:23,808
Viva

2027
01:56:24,811 --> 01:56:26,302
Viva

2028
01:56:27,280 --> 01:56:28,771
Viva

2029
01:56:29,883 --> 01:56:33,114
Viva

2030
01:56:34,387 --> 01:56:41,191
£as Vegas

2031
01:56:45,532 --> 01:56:48,831
Viva
